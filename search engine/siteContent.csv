Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947. According to 2011 census, the majority religion of city is Hinduism practised by 93.5% of the population, followed by Islam (2.29%), Sikhism (1.95%), Buddhism (1.33%) and Christianity (0.62%).[3] Culture[edit] The people of Shimla are informally called Shimlaites. With largely cosmopolitan crowds, a variety of festivals are celebrated here. The Shimla Summer Festival, held every year during peak tourist season,[47] and lasting 3–4 days, is celebrated on the Ridge. The highlights of this event include performances by popular singers from all over the country. Since 2015, 95.0 BIG FM[48] and Himachal Tourism have been jointly organizing a 7-days long winter carnival on the Ridge from Christmas to New year.[49][50][51] Shimla has a number of places to visit. Local hangouts like the Mall and the Ridge are in the heart of the city. Most of the heritage buildings in the city are preserved in their original 'Tudorbethan' architecture. The former Viceregal Lodge, which now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and Wildflower Hall, now a luxury hotel, are some of the famous ones. A collection of paintings, jewellery and textiles of the region can be found at the State Museum (built in 1974). Foggy morning at Tattapani Lakkar Bazaar, a market extending off the Ridge, is famous for souvenirs and crafts made of wood. Tatta Pani, 55 kilometres (34.2 mi) from the main city, is the name of hot sulfur springs that are believed to have medicinal value located on the banks of the River Satluj. Shimla is also home to South Asia's only natural ice skating rink.[52] State and national level competitions are often held at this venue. Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years. Shimla has many temples and is often visited by devotees from nearby towns and cities. The Kali Bari temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali is near the mall. Jakhoo Temple, for the Hindu god Hanuman is located at the highest point in Shimla.[53] Sankat Mochan, another Hanuman temple, is famous for the numerous monkeys that are always found in its vicinity. It is located on Shimla-Kalka Highway about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the city. The nearby temple of Tara Devi is a place for performing rituals and festivals. Other prominent places of worship include a Gurudwara near the bus terminus and Christ Church on the Ridge. A folk celebration in Shimla Shimla arts and crafts are highly in demand by the tourists. They range from excellent pieces of jewellery, embroidered shawls and garments to leather made articles and sculptures. Shimla is full of pine and deodar trees. The wood has been extensively used in all major buildings of Shimla. The various kinds crafts of Shimla made out of wood includes small boxes, utensils, image carvings and souvenirs.

The other arts and crafts of Shimla includes a huge collection of beaded and metal jewellery. The culture of Shimla throwbacks religious, agnostic Kumauni people with simple lifestyle living away from the hustle and bustle of metro cities. Shimla has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. The ice skating season usually begins in the start of December and goes on till the end of February. The city has sporting venues like the Indira Gandhi Rajya Khel Parisar, the main sports complex. Further out from the city is the Naldehra nine-hole golf course, the oldest of its kind in India.[54] Kufri is a ski resort (winter only) located 19 kilometres (11.8 mi) from the main city.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947.

Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time.

As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years.

The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947. According to 2011 census, the majority religion of city is Hinduism practised by 93.5% of the population, followed by Islam (2.29%), Sikhism (1.95%), Buddhism (1.33%) and Christianity (0.62%).[3] Culture[edit] The people of Shimla are informally called Shimlaites. With largely cosmopolitan crowds, a variety of festivals are celebrated here. The Shimla Summer Festival, held every year during peak tourist season,[47] and lasting 3–4 days, is celebrated on the Ridge. The highlights of this event include performances by popular singers from all over the country. Since 2015, 95.0 BIG FM[48] and Himachal Tourism have been jointly organizing a 7-days long winter carnival on the Ridge from Christmas to New year.[49][50][51] Shimla has a number of places to visit. Local hangouts like the Mall and the Ridge are in the heart of the city. Most of the heritage buildings in the city are preserved in their original 'Tudorbethan' architecture. The former Viceregal Lodge, which now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and Wildflower Hall, now a luxury hotel, are some of the famous ones. A collection of paintings, jewellery and textiles of the region can be found at the State Museum (built in 1974). Foggy morning at Tattapani Lakkar Bazaar, a market extending off the Ridge, is famous for souvenirs and crafts made of wood. Tatta Pani, 55 kilometres (34.2 mi) from the main city, is the name of hot sulfur springs that are believed to have medicinal value located on the banks of the River Satluj. Shimla is also home to South Asia's only natural ice skating rink.[52] State and national level competitions are often held at this venue. Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years. Shimla has many temples and is often visited by devotees from nearby towns and cities. The Kali Bari temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali is near the mall. Jakhoo Temple, for the Hindu god Hanuman is located at the highest point in Shimla.[53] Sankat Mochan, another Hanuman temple, is famous for the numerous monkeys that are always found in its vicinity.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches.

In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital.

Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947. According to 2011 census, the majority religion of city is Hinduism practised by 93.5% of the population, followed by Islam (2.29%), Sikhism (1.95%), Buddhism (1.33%) and Christianity (0.62%).[3] Culture[edit] The people of Shimla are informally called Shimlaites. With largely cosmopolitan crowds, a variety of festivals are celebrated here. The Shimla Summer Festival, held every year during peak tourist season,[47] and lasting 3–4 days, is celebrated on the Ridge. The highlights of this event include performances by popular singers from all over the country. Since 2015, 95.0 BIG FM[48] and Himachal Tourism have been jointly organizing a 7-days long winter carnival on the Ridge from Christmas to New year.[49][50][51] Shimla has a number of places to visit. Local hangouts like the Mall and the Ridge are in the heart of the city. Most of the heritage buildings in the city are preserved in their original 'Tudorbethan' architecture. The former Viceregal Lodge, which now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and Wildflower Hall, now a luxury hotel, are some of the famous ones. A collection of paintings, jewellery and textiles of the region can be found at the State Museum (built in 1974). Foggy morning at Tattapani Lakkar Bazaar, a market extending off the Ridge, is famous for souvenirs and crafts made of wood. Tatta Pani, 55 kilometres (34.2 mi) from the main city, is the name of hot sulfur springs that are believed to have medicinal value located on the banks of the River Satluj. Shimla is also home to South Asia's only natural ice skating rink.[52] State and national level competitions are often held at this venue. Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years. Shimla has many temples and is often visited by devotees from nearby towns and cities. The Kali Bari temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali is near the mall. Jakhoo Temple, for the Hindu god Hanuman is located at the highest point in Shimla.[53] Sankat Mochan, another Hanuman temple, is famous for the numerous monkeys that are always found in its vicinity. It is located on Shimla-Kalka Highway about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the city. The nearby temple of Tara Devi is a place for performing rituals and festivals. Other prominent places of worship include a Gurudwara near the bus terminus and Christ Church on the Ridge. A folk celebration in Shimla Shimla arts and crafts are highly in demand by the tourists. They range from excellent pieces of jewellery, embroidered shawls and garments to leather made articles and sculptures. Shimla is full of pine and deodar trees. The wood has been extensively used in all major buildings of Shimla. The various kinds crafts of Shimla made out of wood includes small boxes, utensils, image carvings and souvenirs.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government.

The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947. According to 2011 census, the majority religion of city is Hinduism practised by 93.5% of the population, followed by Islam (2.29%), Sikhism (1.95%), Buddhism (1.33%) and Christianity (0.62%).[3] Culture[edit] The people of Shimla are informally called Shimlaites. With largely cosmopolitan crowds, a variety of festivals are celebrated here. The Shimla Summer Festival, held every year during peak tourist season,[47] and lasting 3–4 days, is celebrated on the Ridge. The highlights of this event include performances by popular singers from all over the country. Since 2015, 95.0 BIG FM[48] and Himachal Tourism have been jointly organizing a 7-days long winter carnival on the Ridge from Christmas to New year.[49][50][51] Shimla has a number of places to visit. Local hangouts like the Mall and the Ridge are in the heart of the city. Most of the heritage buildings in the city are preserved in their original 'Tudorbethan' architecture. The former Viceregal Lodge, which now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and Wildflower Hall, now a luxury hotel, are some of the famous ones. A collection of paintings, jewellery and textiles of the region can be found at the State Museum (built in 1974). Foggy morning at Tattapani Lakkar Bazaar, a market extending off the Ridge, is famous for souvenirs and crafts made of wood. Tatta Pani, 55 kilometres (34.2 mi) from the main city, is the name of hot sulfur springs that are believed to have medicinal value located on the banks of the River Satluj. Shimla is also home to South Asia's only natural ice skating rink.[52] State and national level competitions are often held at this venue. Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years. Shimla has many temples and is often visited by devotees from nearby towns and cities. The Kali Bari temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali is near the mall. Jakhoo Temple, for the Hindu god Hanuman is located at the highest point in Shimla.[53] Sankat Mochan, another Hanuman temple, is famous for the numerous monkeys that are always found in its vicinity.

The scenic Kalka Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge track, is listed in the Guinness Book of Records for the steepest rise in altitude in a distance of 96 km.[62] Kalka, the plains rail terminus, has daily departures to major Indian cities. The city has a total of three railway stations with Shimla the main station and two others located at Summer Hill and Totu (Jutogh) respectively. It was built to connect Shimla, the summer capital of India during the British Raj, with the Indian rail system. The route is famous for its scenery and improbable construction. In 2007, the government of Himachal Pradesh declared the railway a heritage property.[63] For about a week starting on 11 September 2007, an expert team from UNESCO visited the railway to review and inspect it for possible selection as a World Heritage Site. On 8 July 2008, the Kalka–Shimla Railway became part of the World Heritage Site Mountain railways of India.[64] alongside Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.[65] Media and communications[edit] State-owned All India Radio and Reliance Broadcast owned 95.0 BIG FM have local radio stations in Shimla, which transmits various programmes of mass interest. Apart from a wide range of other national and international TV channels of different languages, the national TV broadcaster Doordarshan also broadcast channels like DD Shimla, DD National and DD Sports in the city.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches.

In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital.

Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947. According to 2011 census, the majority religion of city is Hinduism practised by 93.5% of the population, followed by Islam (2.29%), Sikhism (1.95%), Buddhism (1.33%) and Christianity (0.62%).[3] Culture[edit] The people of Shimla are informally called Shimlaites. With largely cosmopolitan crowds, a variety of festivals are celebrated here. The Shimla Summer Festival, held every year during peak tourist season,[47] and lasting 3–4 days, is celebrated on the Ridge. The highlights of this event include performances by popular singers from all over the country. Since 2015, 95.0 BIG FM[48] and Himachal Tourism have been jointly organizing a 7-days long winter carnival on the Ridge from Christmas to New year.[49][50][51] Shimla has a number of places to visit. Local hangouts like the Mall and the Ridge are in the heart of the city. Most of the heritage buildings in the city are preserved in their original 'Tudorbethan' architecture. The former Viceregal Lodge, which now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and Wildflower Hall, now a luxury hotel, are some of the famous ones. A collection of paintings, jewellery and textiles of the region can be found at the State Museum (built in 1974). Foggy morning at Tattapani Lakkar Bazaar, a market extending off the Ridge, is famous for souvenirs and crafts made of wood. Tatta Pani, 55 kilometres (34.2 mi) from the main city, is the name of hot sulfur springs that are believed to have medicinal value located on the banks of the River Satluj. Shimla is also home to South Asia's only natural ice skating rink.[52] State and national level competitions are often held at this venue. Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years. Shimla has many temples and is often visited by devotees from nearby towns and cities. The Kali Bari temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali is near the mall. Jakhoo Temple, for the Hindu god Hanuman is located at the highest point in Shimla.[53] Sankat Mochan, another Hanuman temple, is famous for the numerous monkeys that are always found in its vicinity. It is located on Shimla-Kalka Highway about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the city. The nearby temple of Tara Devi is a place for performing rituals and festivals. Other prominent places of worship include a Gurudwara near the bus terminus and Christ Church on the Ridge. A folk celebration in Shimla Shimla arts and crafts are highly in demand by the tourists. They range from excellent pieces of jewellery, embroidered shawls and garments to leather made articles and sculptures. Shimla is full of pine and deodar trees. The wood has been extensively used in all major buildings of Shimla. The various kinds crafts of Shimla made out of wood includes small boxes, utensils, image carvings and souvenirs.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh.

I am under the impression that this is the same module used http://www.readability.com/ and in apples safari read protocol."
http://lxml.de/installation.html,"Installing lxml Where to get it lxml is generally distributed through PyPI. Most Linux platforms come with some version of lxml readily packaged, usually named python-lxml for the Python 2.x version and python3-lxml for Python 3.x. If you can use that version, the quickest way to install lxml is to use the system package manager, e.g. apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python3-lxml For MacOS-X, a macport of lxml is available. Try something like sudo port install py27-lxml To install a newer version or to install lxml on other systems, see below. Requirements You need Python 2.6 or later. Unless you are using a static binary distribution (e.g. from a Windows binary installer), lxml requires libxml2 and libxslt to be installed, in particular: libxml2 version 2.7.0 or later. We recommend libxml2 2.9.2 or a later version. If you want to use the feed parser interface, especially when parsing from unicode strings, do not use libxml2 2.7.4 through 2.7.6. libxslt version 1.1.23 or later. We recommend libxslt 1.1.28 or later. Version 1.1.25 will not work due to a missing library symbol. Newer versions generally contain fewer bugs and are therefore recommended. XML Schema support is also still worked on in libxml2, so newer versions will give you better compliance with the W3C spec. To install the required development packages of these dependencies on Linux systems, use your distribution specific installation tool, e.g. apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev For Debian based systems, it should be enough to install the known build dependencies of the provided lxml package, e.g. sudo apt-get build-dep python3-lxml Installation If your system does not provide binary packages or you want to install a newer version, the best way is to get the pip package management tool (or use a virtualenv) and run the following: pip install lxml If you are not using pip in a virtualenv and want to install lxml globally instead, you have to run the above command as admin, e.g. on Linux: sudo pip install lxml To install a specific version, either download the distribution manually and let pip install that, or pass the desired version to pip: pip install lxml==3.4.2 To speed up the build in test environments, e.g. on a continuous integration server, disable the C compiler optimisations by setting the CFLAGS environment variable: CFLAGS=""-O0"" pip install lxml (The option reads ""minus Oh Zero"", i.e. zero optimisations.) MS Windows For MS Windows, recent lxml releases feature community donated binary distributions, although you might still want to take a look at the related FAQ entry. If you fail to build lxml on your MS Windows system from the signed and tested sources that we release, consider using the binary builds from PyPI or the unofficial Windows binaries that Christoph Gohlke generously provides. Linux On Linux (and most other well-behaved operating systems), pip will manage to build the source distribution as long as libxml2 and libxslt are properly installed, including development packages, i.e. header files, etc. See the requirements section above and use your system package management tool to look for packages like libxml2-dev or libxslt-devel. If the build fails, make sure they are installed. Alternatively, setting STATIC_DEPS=true will download and build both libraries automatically in their latest version, e.g. STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml. MacOS-X On MacOS-X, use the following to build the source distribution, and make sure you have a working Internet connection, as this will download libxml2 and libxslt in order to build them: STATIC_DEPS=true sudo pip install lxml Building lxml from dev sources If you want to build lxml from the GitHub repository, you should read how to build lxml from source (or the file doc/build.txt in the source tree). Building from developer sources or from modified distribution sources requires Cython to translate the lxml sources into C code. The source distribution ships with pre-generated C source files, so you do not need Cython installed to build from release sources. If you have read these instructions and still cannot manage to install lxml, you can check the archives of the mailing list to see if your problem is known or otherwise send a mail to the list. Using lxml with python-libxml2 If you want to use lxml together with the official libxml2 Python bindings (maybe because one of your dependencies uses it), you must build lxml statically. Otherwise, the two packages will interfere in places where the libxml2 library requires global configuration, which can have any kind of effect from disappearing functionality to crashes in either of the two. To get a static build, either pass the --static-deps option to the setup.py script, or run pip with the STATIC_DEPS or STATICBUILD environment variable set to true, i.e. STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml The STATICBUILD environment variable is handled equivalently to the STATIC_DEPS variable, but is used by some other extension packages, too. Source builds on MS Windows Most MS Windows systems lack the necessarily tools to build software, starting with a C compiler already. Microsoft leaves it to users to install and configure them, which is usually not trivial and means that distributors cannot rely on these dependencies being available on a given system. In a way, you get what you've paid for and make others pay for it. Due to the additional lack of package management of this platform, it is best to link the library dependencies statically if you decide to build from sources, rather than using a binary installer. For that, lxml can use the binary distribution of libxml2 and libxslt, which it downloads automatically during the static build. It needs both libxml2 and libxslt, as well as iconv and zlib, which are available from the same download site. Further build instructions are in the source build documentation. Source builds on MacOS-X If you are not using macports or want to use a more recent lxml release, you have to build it yourself. While the pre-installed system libraries of libxml2 and libxslt are less outdated in recent MacOS-X versions than they used to be, so lxml should work with them out of the box, it is still recommended to use a static build with the most recent library versions. Luckily, lxml's setup.py script has built-in support for building and integrating these libraries statically during the build. Please read the MacOS-X build instructions."

http://jakeaustwick.me/scraping-content-with-readability-and-python/,"07 Mar 2014 on screen scraping, requests, readability Scraping content with readability and python This is only going to be a short one. If you want to scrape the main content of a site only (we aren't interested in the menu/sidebar etc), then you can use the python port of the readability library. Jump to final code We'll simply fetch the page using Kenneth Reitz's requests library, and then extract the content with readability. I'll be using Redis to store the results, simply because I didn't want the extra overhead of having to install a RDBMS for this project. Installing libaries pip install redis requests readability-lxml First we'll create a generator to yield urls we want to fetch from a text file. We'll only yield the url if we don't already have the content for it stored though. import redis r = redis.StrictRedis() def urls(): for url in open('urls.txt', 'r'): if not r.hexists('url-content', url): yield url Now we can iterate over this, fetching the content, running it through readability and then storing the results in redis. It's as simple as it sounds. Final Code import redis import requests from readability.readability import Document r = redis.StrictRedis() def urls(): for url in open('urls.txt', 'r'): if not r.hexists('url-content', url): yield url if __name__ == '__main__': for url in urls(): try: response = requests.get(url, timeout=10) # Only store the content if the page load was successful if response.ok: page_content = Document(response.content).summary() r.hset('url-content', url, page_content) except: print 'Error processing URL: %s' % url print 'Processed all URLs' And there you have it, scraping and storing content of the urls loaded from a text file, all in < 25 lines of Python."

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning,"About this course: Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,"Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to ""learn"" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.[1] The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.[2] Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,[3] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,[5]:2 through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach,[6] optical character recognition (OCR),[7] learning to rank, and computer vision. Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,[8] where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning.[5]:vii[9] Machine learning can also be unsupervised[10] and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities[11] and then used to find meaningful anomalies. Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to ""produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results"" and uncover ""hidden insights"" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.[12] Effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver.[13][14] Overview[edit] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.""[15] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".[16] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed. Machine learning tasks[edit] Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether there is a learning ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to a learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback: Semi-supervised learning: the computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. Active learning: the computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling. Reinforcement learning: training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent.[5]:3 Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Machine learning applications[edit] Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:[5]:3 In classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are ""spam"" and ""not spam"". In regression, also a supervised problem, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. In clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task. Density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space. Dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics. Among other categories of machine learning problems, learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience. Developmental learning, elaborated for robot learning, generates its own sequences (also called curriculum) of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation. History and relationships to other fields[edit] Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term ""Machine Learning"" in 1959 while at IBM[17]. As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[19]:25 Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[20] It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the Internet. Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.[21] Relation to statistics[edit] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields. According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[22] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[22] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[23] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[24] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[25][26] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error. For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[27] In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches[edit] Decision tree learning[edit] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model, which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value. Association rule learning[edit] Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Artificial neural networks[edit] An artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called ""neural network"" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is vaguely inspired by biological neural networks. Computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables. Deep learning[edit] Falling hardware prices and the development of GPUs for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[28] Inductive logic programming[edit] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Support vector machines[edit] Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. Clustering[edit] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness (similarity between members of the same cluster) and separation between different clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data analysis. Bayesian networks[edit] A Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Reinforcement learning[edit] Reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of long-term reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected. Representation learning[edit] Several learning algorithms, mostly unsupervised learning algorithms, aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. Classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions, allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse (has many zeros). Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors.[29] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[30] Similarity and metric learning[edit] In this problem, the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects. It then needs to learn a similarity function (or a distance metric function) that can predict if new objects are similar. It is sometimes used in Recommendation systems. Sparse dictionary learning[edit] In this method, a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse. Let x be a d-dimensional datum, D be a d by n matrix, where each column of D represents a basis function. r is the coefficient to represent x using D. Mathematically, sparse dictionary learning means solving x  D r {\displaystyle x\approx Dr} where r is sparse. Generally speaking, n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation. Learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard and also difficult to solve approximately.[31] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is K-SVD. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to. Suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built. Then a new datum is associated with the class such that it's best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[32] Genetic algorithms[edit] A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, and uses methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms found some uses in the 1980s and 1990s.[33][34] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[35] Rule-based machine learning[edit] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves `rules’ to store, manipulate or apply, knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[36] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Learning classifier systems[edit] Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component (e.g. typically a genetic algorithm) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning). They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[37] Applications[edit] Applications for machine learning include: In 2006, the online movie company Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[43] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[44] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of Machine Learning to predict the financial crisis. [45] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[46] In 2014, it has been reported that a machine learning algorithm has been applied in Art History to study fine art paintings, and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences between artists.[47] Model assessments[edit] Classification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the N-fold-cross-validation method randomly splits the data in k subsets where the k-1 instances of the data are used to train the model while the kth instance is used to test the predictive ability of the training model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[48] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the False Negative Rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model’s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC’s associated Area Under the Curve (AUC). Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[49] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[50][51] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning. Because language contains biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn bias.[52] Software[edit] Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following : Free and open-source software[edit] Proprietary software with free and open-source editions[edit] Proprietary software[edit] Journals[edit] Conferences[edit] See also[edit] References[edit] ^ Supposedly paraphrased from: Samuel, Arthur (1959).

https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-weirdest-rumors-about-the-marvel-cinematic-universe-1825113822,"Poster art of gathered Marvel heroes (and villains) for Avengers: Infinity WarImage: Ryan Meinerding (Marvel Studios)This month, years of meticulous movie planning will culminate in the release of Avengers: Infinity War, smashing together heroes from a decade’s worth of some of the biggest films on the planet. The road to Infinity War has been paved with a decade of reporting around it—some of it leading to some very bizarre rumors that, unsurprisingly, weren’t true.The Chitauri, the ultimate villainous hordes of Avengers.Image: Marvel StudiosThe Skrulls Are the Threat That Will Bring the Avengers TogetherBack when the idea of something like Guardians of the Galaxy or Civil War were but twinkles in Kevin Feige’s eyes, and we somehow got excited by a meager six comic book characters teaming up—everyone turned to 2012's The Avengers to see what cataclysmic threat from the comics would finally unite the separate heroes of the fledgling MCU. At the top of the list: the Skrulls, the shapechanging alien warriors whose grand storyline in “Secret Invasion” was still relatively fresh in the minds of fans.The Skrulls were always unlikely—they were usually considered relatively off-limits in the Marvel movies due to several Skrull characters being part of Fox’s cache of movie rights. But also, “Secret Invasion” being introduced so early into the MCU would’ve been crazy, and a comics-fan pipe dream at most. That didn’t stop fans, though, who rapidly moved on to Badoon being the culprits (once again, Fox movie rights wrangling meant that was a no-go, too) until eventually it was revealed that the Chitauri would be Avengers’ horde of badguys. And... that was that. No one really cared in the end, anyway. It was all about the Avengers avenging things!Nova, aka Not Nathan Fillion.Image: Mike Deodato Jr. (Marvel Comics)Nathan Fillion Will Be NovaOh, Nathan Fillion, how many times have you been rumored to be joining the MCU in a major way? The first mention, however, will always be the greatest. When Guardians of the Galaxy was first in the works, rumors began swirling about the film’s inclusion of the Nova Corps, the Marvel Comics Universe’s group of cosmic supercops most famously known for being the group to which the hero Nova, a.k.a. Richard Rider, belonged. This led to the assumption Rider himself would be in the film alongside the rest of the Corps, and when rumors started swirling that former Firefly star Fillion was going to appear in the film, fans put two and a different two together and naturally assumed he had to be Nova. Even when James Gunn denied it, people still assumed Fillion would be a post-credit tease for future cosmic-bound Marvel films.But... he wasn’t. In fact, most people probably wouldn’t recognize Fillion in the final movie at all—he played one of the alien prisoners Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Gamora encounter in the Kyln, under heavy prostheses. Vol. 2 followed up with a cheeky set of posters casting Fillion as an actual Marvel superhero to make up for it: Simon Williams, the superhero-turned-actor Wonder Man. Coulson breathing his final breaths in Avengers... before he sneakily headed to ABC, that is.Image: Marvel StudiosPhil Coulson Will Become the VisionAgent Coulson’s untimely demise in the first Avengers movie led to all sorts of crazy rumors about how he’d make his way back to the land of the living (he would, but on TV for Agents of SHIELD, with an altogether more elaborate method for his resurrection). The craziest by far however was that Coulson’s body would become the form that the Vision, who would go on to debut in the Avengers sequel, would be based on. Which... is silly. Why would Vision adopt the form of a dead SHIELD agent? Why would Ultron randomly decide the face of Coulson should be the avatar of his vengeance against Tony Stark and the Avengers? Even Coulson himself, Gregg Clark, thought it was a bit nonsensical. Thankfully, as we now know, it wasn’t the case; Paul Bettany, who already provided the voice of Tony’s A.I. servant Jarvis, went on to play the Vision. But still, think of the complete weirdness Agents of SHIELD would’ve become if Gregg was running around in the Vision’s get-up.The original Captain Marvel on the cover of Secret Avengers #27.Image: Alan Davis (Marvel Comics)Star-Lord’s Dad Will Be the Original Captain MarvelThe unknown, cosmic identity of Star-Lord’s father plays a small role in his backstory in the first Guardians movie, and was a driving force behind the events of its sequel. When it was first announced that Peter’s dad would be a major character in the sequel—and that, unlike in the comics, it would not be the alien J’son of Spartax—rumors began flinging about as to who it might be before settling on Captain Marvel.No, not Carol Danvers—that would’ve been even weirder. This theory referred to Mar-Vell, the Kree supersoldier who was the first Captain Marvel in the comics, and whose powers were given to Carol in a freak accident, allowing her to become Ms. Marvel and eventually Captain Marvel herself. The first Guardians film had already introduced the Kree in the form of Ronan, and with confirmation of a Carol Danvers movie finally happening, the rumors seemed reasonable at first, even if still pretty out there. But at Comic-Con 2016 James Gunn once again denied rumors and instead revealed that Peter’s father would be Ego the Living Planet, known in the comics for being, well... a planet. With an ego.Actually, that one may have ended up even weirder than the Mar-Vell rumor.Carol suits up in the cover art for Captain Marvel #1's relaunch in 2014.Image: David Lopez (Marvel Comics)Meanwhile, Captain Marvel Will Be Showing Up... Basically EverywhereEven before her own movie was confirmed, rumors of Captain Marvel showing up all over the place in the MCU were constant. First there was talk that she would debut in Age of Ultron, only for Marvel to firmly deny it. Then, weirdly enough, the company revealed that there was a draft where Carol made her cameo debut in the film’s final scenes, but that was cut—and then revealed that Joss Whedon shot test footage to insert Carol into, but it was instead used for Scarlet Witch in the final film. Either way, no Captain Marvel so far.Most recently, of course, we have rumors of her involvement in Infinity War, which seem more and more unlikely by the day, especially with a few reports that she’ll instead show up in Avengers 4—so please continue waiting for Carol Danvers for now.The Vision, at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, not contemplating leaving the planet.Image: Marvel StudiosA Bummed-Out Vision Will Go to Space at the End of Civil WarGiven the ever-closer threat of Thanos in the MCU, and the fact that the Vision’s forehead houses one of the Infinity Stones the Titan covets, many fans have long believed the synthezoid superhero would eventually end up in the cosmic side of the Marvel movie-verse... and then very dead at Thanos’ hands. Then came an elaborate rumor ahead of Captain America: Civil War that suggested that Vision, dismayed by infighting among the Avengers, would simply float up and away off Earth during the climax of the movie, heading off into space to make possible appearances in the then-upcoming Guardians sequel or Thor: Ragnarok before meeting his untimely end before Infinity War. Thankfully, that never ended up being the case—and while we know Vision plays a hugely important role in Infinity War, he didn’t have to randomly blast into space to do so.Chris Evans as Captain America in the actual ending of Captain America: Civil War.Image: Marvel StudiosCaptain America: Civil War Shot Two Endings, Including One Where Captain America DiedTurns out that naming a Captain America movie after a comic book event that ends with Captain America being assassinated (he got better, it’s a long story) will lead to rumors that Captain America will croak in the movie version, no matter how wildly divergent from the comic book storylines the movies had already shown themselves to be by the time Civil War was hitting theaters. But it wasn’t the rumors of a Cap death that were themselves that surprising; after all, there was a solid basis for it in the comics. It only got weird when a rumor started getting around that Marvel was planning to shoot two very divergent paths for the MCU.Allegedly, the reports claimed, the Russo Brothers were preparing to direct two completely different endings for the movie. In one, Captain America ended the film on the run (as he did in the final movie). In the other, however, he surrendered to the Sokovia Accords, only to be assassinated, just as he was in the comics. In the end, though, this was complete bullshit—the Russos barely even considered taking the comic’s ending for the film.Ty Simpkins as Iron Man 3's Harley Keener. Helmet’s a bit big for him, don’t you think?Image: Marvel StudiosThat Kid From Iron Man 3 Will Be the New Iron ManAs it’s become public how much Marvel pays to keep Robert Downey Jr. in the Iron Man suit, people are getting increasingly interested/concerned about when the actor will inevitably leave the MCU. With Avengers: Infinity War representing a climax to the current status quo of the movie universe, it’s almost become accepted that this is likely the end for Tony Stark as we know him. So who could replace him? While the obvious answer is Rhodey, that rather logical assumption didn’t stop rumors from popping up on IMDB that Ty Simpkins, who played Harley, the young kid who Tony befriended in Iron Man 3, had joined the cast of Avengers 4 in an unspecified role. This naturally led to the assumption that he would somehow be replacing Tony as the new Iron Man, despite being a literal child. Sure, Avengers 4 isn’t actually out yet so who knows, but we’re pretty safe that li’l Harley won’t be putting on some armor in the post-Infinity War world."

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947. According to 2011 census, the majority religion of city is Hinduism practised by 93.5% of the population, followed by Islam (2.29%), Sikhism (1.95%), Buddhism (1.33%) and Christianity (0.62%).[3] Culture[edit] The people of Shimla are informally called Shimlaites. With largely cosmopolitan crowds, a variety of festivals are celebrated here. The Shimla Summer Festival, held every year during peak tourist season,[47] and lasting 3–4 days, is celebrated on the Ridge. The highlights of this event include performances by popular singers from all over the country. Since 2015, 95.0 BIG FM[48] and Himachal Tourism have been jointly organizing a 7-days long winter carnival on the Ridge from Christmas to New year.[49][50][51] Shimla has a number of places to visit. Local hangouts like the Mall and the Ridge are in the heart of the city. Most of the heritage buildings in the city are preserved in their original 'Tudorbethan' architecture. The former Viceregal Lodge, which now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and Wildflower Hall, now a luxury hotel, are some of the famous ones. A collection of paintings, jewellery and textiles of the region can be found at the State Museum (built in 1974). Foggy morning at Tattapani Lakkar Bazaar, a market extending off the Ridge, is famous for souvenirs and crafts made of wood. Tatta Pani, 55 kilometres (34.2 mi) from the main city, is the name of hot sulfur springs that are believed to have medicinal value located on the banks of the River Satluj. Shimla is also home to South Asia's only natural ice skating rink.[52] State and national level competitions are often held at this venue. Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years. Shimla has many temples and is often visited by devotees from nearby towns and cities. The Kali Bari temple, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali is near the mall. Jakhoo Temple, for the Hindu god Hanuman is located at the highest point in Shimla.[53] Sankat Mochan, another Hanuman temple, is famous for the numerous monkeys that are always found in its vicinity.

I am under the impression that this is the same module used http://www.readability.com/ and in apples safari read protocol."
http://lxml.de/installation.html,"Installing lxml Where to get it lxml is generally distributed through PyPI. Most Linux platforms come with some version of lxml readily packaged, usually named python-lxml for the Python 2.x version and python3-lxml for Python 3.x. If you can use that version, the quickest way to install lxml is to use the system package manager, e.g. apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python3-lxml For MacOS-X, a macport of lxml is available. Try something like sudo port install py27-lxml To install a newer version or to install lxml on other systems, see below. Requirements You need Python 2.6 or later. Unless you are using a static binary distribution (e.g. from a Windows binary installer), lxml requires libxml2 and libxslt to be installed, in particular: libxml2 version 2.7.0 or later. We recommend libxml2 2.9.2 or a later version. If you want to use the feed parser interface, especially when parsing from unicode strings, do not use libxml2 2.7.4 through 2.7.6. libxslt version 1.1.23 or later. We recommend libxslt 1.1.28 or later. Version 1.1.25 will not work due to a missing library symbol. Newer versions generally contain fewer bugs and are therefore recommended. XML Schema support is also still worked on in libxml2, so newer versions will give you better compliance with the W3C spec. To install the required development packages of these dependencies on Linux systems, use your distribution specific installation tool, e.g. apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev For Debian based systems, it should be enough to install the known build dependencies of the provided lxml package, e.g. sudo apt-get build-dep python3-lxml Installation If your system does not provide binary packages or you want to install a newer version, the best way is to get the pip package management tool (or use a virtualenv) and run the following: pip install lxml If you are not using pip in a virtualenv and want to install lxml globally instead, you have to run the above command as admin, e.g. on Linux: sudo pip install lxml To install a specific version, either download the distribution manually and let pip install that, or pass the desired version to pip: pip install lxml==3.4.2 To speed up the build in test environments, e.g. on a continuous integration server, disable the C compiler optimisations by setting the CFLAGS environment variable: CFLAGS=""-O0"" pip install lxml (The option reads ""minus Oh Zero"", i.e. zero optimisations.) MS Windows For MS Windows, recent lxml releases feature community donated binary distributions, although you might still want to take a look at the related FAQ entry. If you fail to build lxml on your MS Windows system from the signed and tested sources that we release, consider using the binary builds from PyPI or the unofficial Windows binaries that Christoph Gohlke generously provides. Linux On Linux (and most other well-behaved operating systems), pip will manage to build the source distribution as long as libxml2 and libxslt are properly installed, including development packages, i.e. header files, etc. See the requirements section above and use your system package management tool to look for packages like libxml2-dev or libxslt-devel. If the build fails, make sure they are installed. Alternatively, setting STATIC_DEPS=true will download and build both libraries automatically in their latest version, e.g. STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml. MacOS-X On MacOS-X, use the following to build the source distribution, and make sure you have a working Internet connection, as this will download libxml2 and libxslt in order to build them: STATIC_DEPS=true sudo pip install lxml Building lxml from dev sources If you want to build lxml from the GitHub repository, you should read how to build lxml from source (or the file doc/build.txt in the source tree). Building from developer sources or from modified distribution sources requires Cython to translate the lxml sources into C code. The source distribution ships with pre-generated C source files, so you do not need Cython installed to build from release sources. If you have read these instructions and still cannot manage to install lxml, you can check the archives of the mailing list to see if your problem is known or otherwise send a mail to the list. Using lxml with python-libxml2 If you want to use lxml together with the official libxml2 Python bindings (maybe because one of your dependencies uses it), you must build lxml statically. Otherwise, the two packages will interfere in places where the libxml2 library requires global configuration, which can have any kind of effect from disappearing functionality to crashes in either of the two. To get a static build, either pass the --static-deps option to the setup.py script, or run pip with the STATIC_DEPS or STATICBUILD environment variable set to true, i.e. STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml The STATICBUILD environment variable is handled equivalently to the STATIC_DEPS variable, but is used by some other extension packages, too. Source builds on MS Windows Most MS Windows systems lack the necessarily tools to build software, starting with a C compiler already. Microsoft leaves it to users to install and configure them, which is usually not trivial and means that distributors cannot rely on these dependencies being available on a given system. In a way, you get what you've paid for and make others pay for it. Due to the additional lack of package management of this platform, it is best to link the library dependencies statically if you decide to build from sources, rather than using a binary installer. For that, lxml can use the binary distribution of libxml2 and libxslt, which it downloads automatically during the static build. It needs both libxml2 and libxslt, as well as iconv and zlib, which are available from the same download site. Further build instructions are in the source build documentation. Source builds on MacOS-X If you are not using macports or want to use a more recent lxml release, you have to build it yourself. While the pre-installed system libraries of libxml2 and libxslt are less outdated in recent MacOS-X versions than they used to be, so lxml should work with them out of the box, it is still recommended to use a static build with the most recent library versions. Luckily, lxml's setup.py script has built-in support for building and integrating these libraries statically during the build. Please read the MacOS-X build instructions."

Jump to final code We'll simply fetch the page using Kenneth Reitz's requests library, and then extract the content with readability. I'll be using Redis to store the results, simply because I didn't want the extra overhead of having to install a RDBMS for this project.

Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India, succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the hilly regions of the state. Small hamlets were recorded prior to 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of Himalayas. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the Simla Accord of 1914 and the Simla Conference of 1945. After independence, the state of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 princely states. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the Simla Agreement of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla. Its name is derived from the goddess Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Kali.[citation needed] Shimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge, which together form the city centre. The Kalka–Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions. History[edit] Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the Jakhoo temple and a few scattered houses.[5] The area was called 'Shimla', named after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of Kali.[1] The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal in 1806. The British East India Company took control of the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The Gurkha leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of David Ochterlony in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as ""a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers"". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the Hill States, set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the Scottish[citation needed] civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first pucca house in the area in 1822, near what is now the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of Bengal, visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, Lord Combermere, the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near Jakhu. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of Keonthal and Patiala in exchange for the Rawin pargana and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.[5][6] In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting: between the Governor-General William Bentinck and the emissaries of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:[7] “ Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun (Hindustan). ” Combermere's successor Earl Dalhousie visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from Sood[disambiguation needed] and Parsi communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the Christ Church was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet road with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.[8] The 1857 uprising caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.[5] In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.[5] He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[9] Lord Lytton (Viceroy of India 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a Viceregal Lodge, later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the ""Upper Bazaar"" nowadays known as the Ridge[10]), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration. During the ""Hot Weather"", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, India, the head of the Indian Army, and many Departments of the Government. The summer capital of the regional Government of the Punjab moved from Murree, in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to Charles Allen,[11] ""was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust."" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as Rudyard Kipling said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for ""frivolity, gossip and intrigue"". (See also.[12]) The 500-foot (150 m) Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about 120 feet (37 m) in length, was also built in 1905.[8] The Kalka–Shimla railway line, opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the ""British Jewel of the Orient"".[12] In 2008, it became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mountain railways of India.[13] In addition, Shimla was the capital of the undivided state of Punjab in 1871, and remained so until the construction of the new city of Chandigarh (the present-day capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana). Upon the formation of the state of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla was named its capital. Entrance of the Crowborough Rest House built in 1921 After independence the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalaya, known in full as the Shimla Hills States & four Punjab southern hill states by issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 & 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged in the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution of India and the Lt. Governor was appointed. Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a Union Territory on 1 November 1956.[14] Following area of Punjab State namely Shimla, Kangra, Kulu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Nalagarh tehsil of Ambala District, Lohara, Amb and Una kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una tehsil of Hoshiarpur District besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Tehsil of Pathankot District; were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment of Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 by the Parliament. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Thus Himachal emerged as the eighteenth state of the Indian Union.[14] Pre-independence structures still dot Shimla; buildings such as the former Viceregal Lodge, Auckland House, Christ Church, Gorton Castle, Shimla Town Hall and the Gaiety Theatre are reminders of British rule in India.[15][16] The original Peterhoff, another Viceregal residence, burned down in 1981. British Shimla extended about a mile and a half along the ridge between Jakhoo Hill and Prospect Hill. The central spine was the Mall, which ran along the length of the ridge, with a Mall Extension southwards, closed to all carriages except those of the Viceroy and his wife. Geography[edit] Shimla is on the south-western ranges of the Himalayas at 31°37N 77°06E / 31.61°N 77.10°E / 31.61; 77.10. It has an average altitude of 2,206 metres (7,238 ft) above mean sea level and extends along a ridge with seven spurs. The city stretches nearly 9.2 kilometres (5.7 mi) from east to west.[17] Shimla was built on top of seven hills: Inverarm Hill, Observatory Hill, Prospect Hill, Summer Hill, Bantony Hill, Elysium Hill and Jakhoo Hill. The highest point in Shimla is the Jakhoo hill, which is at a height of 2,454 metres (8,051 ft). The city is a Zone IV (High Damage Risk Zone) per the Earthquake hazard zoning of India. Weak construction techniques and an increasing population pose a serious threat to the already earthquake prone region.[18][19] There are no water bodies near the main city and the closest river, the Sutlej, is about 21 km (13 mi) away.[20] Other rivers that flow through the Shimla district, although further from the city, are the Giri, and Pabbar (both tributaries of Yamuna). The green belt in the Shimla planning area is spread over 414 hectares (1,020 acres).[12] The main forests in and around the city are of pine, deodar, oak and rhododendron.[21] Environmental degradation due to the increasing number of tourists every year without the infrastructure to support them has resulted in Shimla losing its popular appeal as an ecotourism spot.[22] Another rising concern in the region are the frequent number of landslides that often take place after heavy rains.[18][23] The city is situated 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Kalka, 116 km (72 miles) northeast of Chandigarh, 247 km (154 miles) south of Manali and 350 km (219 miles) northeast of Delhi, the national capital. Kalka can be reached within 2.5 hours, Chandigarh can be reached in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Delhi and Manali are both around 7 hours away from Shimla. Climate[edit] Shimla features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Shimla is predominantly cool during winters and moderately warm during summer.[24] Temperatures typically range from 4 °C (25 °F) to 31 °C (88 °F) over the course of a year.[25] The average temperature during summer is between 19 and 28 °C (66 and 82 °F), and between 1 and 10 °C (30 and 50 °F) in winter. Monthly precipitation varies between 15 millimetres (0.59 in) in November and 434 millimetres (17.1 in) in August. It is typically around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) per month during winter and spring, and around 175 millimetres (6.9 in) in June as the monsoon approaches. The average total annual precipitation is 1,575 millimetres (62 in), which is much less than most other hill stations but still much heavier than on the plains. Snowfall in the region, which historically has taken place in the month of December, has lately (over the last fifteen years) been happening in January or early February every year.[26] The maximum snowfall received in recent times was 38.6 centimetres (15.2 in) on 18 January 2013. On two consecutive days (17 and 18 January 2013), the town received 63.6 centimetres (25.0 in) of snow.[27] Climate data for Shimla (1971–2000) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 21.4 (70.5) 22.6 (72.7) 25.8 (78.4) 29.6 (85.3) 32.4 (90.3) 31.5 (88.7) 28.9 (84) 27.8 (82) 28.6 (83.5) 25.6 (78.1) 23.5 (74.3) 20.5 (68.9) 32.4 (90.3) Average high °C (°F) 9.3 (48.7) 10.3 (50.5) 14.5 (58.1) 19.8 (67.6) 23.0 (73.4) 23.8 (74.8) 21.3 (70.3) 20.5 (68.9) 20.4 (68.7) 18.9 (66) 15.4 (59.7) 11.9 (53.4) 17.5 (63.5) Average low °C (°F) 1.2 (29.8) 2.4 (36.3) 6.1 (43) 10.8 (51.4) 13.6 (56.5) 15.1 (59.2) 14.6 (58.3) 14.2 (57.6) 12.9 (55.2) 10.5 (50.9) 7.0 (44.6) 4.0 (39.2) 9.5 (49.1) Record low °C (°F) 10.6 (12.9) 8.5 (16.7) 6.1 (21) 1.3 (29.7) 1.4 (34.5) 7.8 (46) 9.4 (48.9) 10.6 (51.1) 5.0 (41) 0.2 (32.4) 1.1 (30) 12.2 (10) 12.2 (10) Average precipitation mm (inches) 53.0 (2.087) 63.8 (2.512) 68.9 (2.713) 61.3 (2.413) 83.8 (3.299) 185.3 (7.295) 333.0 (13.11) 296.7 (11.681) 148.7 (5.854) 36.3 (1.429) 22.5 (0.886) 21.4 (0.843) 1,374.6 (54.118) Average snowfall cm (inches) 42 (16.5) 43 (16.9) 7 (2.8) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 (2.8) 99 (39) Average rainy days 4.5 5.3 5.9 4.6 6.3 10.1 17.2 16.2 8.8 2.2 1.5 1.8 84.5 Average snowy days 4.2 4.2 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 1.3 11.2 Source: India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010, snow, 1990–2010)[28][29][30] Skating at Simla, c. 1905 Simla and Jutogh, 1911 map Economy[edit] Employment is largely driven by the government and tourism sectors.[31] Education sector and horticultural produce processing comprise most of the remainder. Recently a Model Career Centre has been set-up at Regional Employment Exchange, Shimla to enable bridging the gap between job-seekers and employers. In addition to being the local hub of transport and trade, Shimla is the area's healthcare centre, hosting a medical college and four major hospitals:[32] Indira Gandhi Hospital (Snowdown Hospital,) Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (formerly called Ripon Hospital), Kamla Nehru Hospital and Indus Hospital. The city's development plan aims make Shimla an attractive health tourism spot.[31] The hotel industry is one of the major source of income generation for the city. Shimla leads the list of Indian cities with the highest ranked hotels.[33] National Academy of Audits and Accounts, Yarrows Shimla had always been famous for its quality of education and many important schools have been imparting quality education throughout the state. Along with schools of higher education, several institutes are also present, namely Himachal Pradesh University and Indian Institute of Advanced Study. Recruitment to the IAAS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Civil Services Examination) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to IAAS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla.[34] Students from across India prefer to study in Shimla because of its climate and Queen of Hill Stations status. These have added to the economy of the district as well as the state. Government is trying to promote technology and IT sector as the new area for growth and promotion[35] although not many companies have yet settled in Shimla. There are many new startups in and around Shimla. There are over six call centres in Shimla, including Alturist Technologies and 31 Parallel. Two notable companies that are registered in Shimla are Netgen IT Solutions, an international website development startup with partner offices in USA and Australia, and Himachal Media, a company that deals with content and media publishing. Civic administration[edit] The administrative responsibilities of the city of Shimla and merged areas of Dhalli, Totu and New Shimla reside with the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). All three areas were taken under SMC in 2006–07. Established in 1851, the Shimla Municipal Corporation is an elected body comprising 27 councillors, three of whom are nominated by the Government of Himachal Pradesh.[17] The nominations are based on prominence in the fields of social service, academics and other activities. Thirty-three percent of the seats are reserved for women. The elections take place every five years and the mayor and deputy mayor are elected by and amongst the councilors themselves. Kusum Sadrate and Rakesh Kumar Sharma of BJP are the present Mayor and Deputy Mayor respectively.[36] The administrative head of the corporation is the commissioner who is appointed by the state government. The two major political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress with a third party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), emerging.[37] The city contributes one seat to the state assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and one seat to the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha).[38] Law and order in the city is collectively maintained by the police force, Vigilance Department, enforcement directorate, forensics, fire brigade, prisons service and Home Guard. There are five police stations and three fire stations in Shimla.[39] The Superintendent of Police, Shimla heads the police force. The First Armed Police Battalion, one of the four armed police battalions in the state, is available for assistance to the local police.[40] There are eleven courts in the district including a fast-track court.[41] Demographics[edit] According to 2011 census, Shimla city spread over an area of 35.34 km2 had a population of 169,578 with 93,152 males and 76,426 females.[2][3] Shimla urban agglomeration had a population of 171,817 as per provisional data of 2011 census, out of which males were 94,797 and females were 77,020.[42] The literacy rate of city was 93.63 percent[3] and that of urban agglomeration was 94.14 per cent.[42] The city area has increased considerably along with passage of time. It has stretched from Hiranagar to Dhalli from one side & from Tara Devi to Malyana in the other. As per the 2001 India Census,[43] the city has a population of 142,161 spread over an area of 19.55 km².[17] A floating population of 75,000 is attributed to service industries such as tourism.[17] The largest demographic, 55%, is 16–45 years of age. A further 28% of the population are younger than 15 years. The low sex ratio – 930 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001[44] – is cause for concern, and much lower than the 974 versus 1,000 for Himachal Pradesh state as a whole. The unemployment rate in the city has come down from 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006. This drop is attributed to recent industrialisation, the growth of service industries, and knowledge development.[45] 84% of the population of Shimla city is literate, compared to 80% in Shimla district and 83.87% in the entire state.[46] The majority of Shimla's population consists of natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hindi is the lingua franca of the city, it is the principal spoken language of the city and also the most commonly used language for the official purposes. English is also spoken by a sizeable population, and is the second official language of the city. Other than Hindi, Pahari languages are spoken by the ethnic Pahari people, who form a major part of the population in the city. Punjabi language is prevalent among the ethnic Punjabi migrant population of the city, most of whom are refugees from West Punjab, who settled in the city after the Partition of India in 1947.

Shimla Ice Skating Club, which manages the rink, hosts a carnival every year in January, which includes a fancy dress competition and figure skating events. Due to effects of global warming and increasing urban development in and around Shimla, the number of sessions on ice every winter have been decreasing in the past few years.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,"Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to ""learn"" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.[1] The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.[2] Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,[3] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,[5]:2 through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach,[6] optical character recognition (OCR),[7] learning to rank, and computer vision. Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,[8] where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning.[5]:vii[9] Machine learning can also be unsupervised[10] and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities[11] and then used to find meaningful anomalies. Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to ""produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results"" and uncover ""hidden insights"" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.[12] Effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver.[13][14] Overview[edit] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.""[15] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".[16] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed. Machine learning tasks[edit] Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether there is a learning ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to a learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback: Semi-supervised learning: the computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. Active learning: the computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling. Reinforcement learning: training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent.[5]:3 Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Machine learning applications[edit] Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:[5]:3 In classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are ""spam"" and ""not spam"". In regression, also a supervised problem, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. In clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task. Density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space. Dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics. Among other categories of machine learning problems, learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience. Developmental learning, elaborated for robot learning, generates its own sequences (also called curriculum) of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation. History and relationships to other fields[edit] Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term ""Machine Learning"" in 1959 while at IBM[17]. As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[19]:25 Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[20] It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the Internet. Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.[21] Relation to statistics[edit] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields. According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[22] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[22] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[23] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[24] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[25][26] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error. For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[27] In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches[edit] Decision tree learning[edit] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model, which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value. Association rule learning[edit] Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Artificial neural networks[edit] An artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called ""neural network"" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is vaguely inspired by biological neural networks. Computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables. Deep learning[edit] Falling hardware prices and the development of GPUs for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[28] Inductive logic programming[edit] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Support vector machines[edit] Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. Clustering[edit] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness (similarity between members of the same cluster) and separation between different clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data analysis. Bayesian networks[edit] A Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Reinforcement learning[edit] Reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of long-term reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected. Representation learning[edit] Several learning algorithms, mostly unsupervised learning algorithms, aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. Classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions, allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse (has many zeros). Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors.[29] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[30] Similarity and metric learning[edit] In this problem, the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects. It then needs to learn a similarity function (or a distance metric function) that can predict if new objects are similar. It is sometimes used in Recommendation systems. Sparse dictionary learning[edit] In this method, a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse. Let x be a d-dimensional datum, D be a d by n matrix, where each column of D represents a basis function. r is the coefficient to represent x using D. Mathematically, sparse dictionary learning means solving x  D r {\displaystyle x\approx Dr} where r is sparse. Generally speaking, n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation. Learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard and also difficult to solve approximately.[31] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is K-SVD. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to. Suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built. Then a new datum is associated with the class such that it's best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[32] Genetic algorithms[edit] A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, and uses methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms found some uses in the 1980s and 1990s.[33][34] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[35] Rule-based machine learning[edit] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves `rules’ to store, manipulate or apply, knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[36] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Learning classifier systems[edit] Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component (e.g. typically a genetic algorithm) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning). They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[37] Applications[edit] Applications for machine learning include: In 2006, the online movie company Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[43] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[44] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of Machine Learning to predict the financial crisis. [45] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[46] In 2014, it has been reported that a machine learning algorithm has been applied in Art History to study fine art paintings, and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences between artists.[47] Model assessments[edit] Classification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the N-fold-cross-validation method randomly splits the data in k subsets where the k-1 instances of the data are used to train the model while the kth instance is used to test the predictive ability of the training model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[48] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the False Negative Rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model’s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC’s associated Area Under the Curve (AUC). Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[49] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[50][51] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning. Because language contains biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn bias.[52] Software[edit] Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following : Free and open-source software[edit] Proprietary software with free and open-source editions[edit] Proprietary software[edit] Journals[edit] Conferences[edit] See also[edit] References[edit] ^ Supposedly paraphrased from: Samuel, Arthur (1959).

https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-weirdest-rumors-about-the-marvel-cinematic-universe-1825113822,"Poster art of gathered Marvel heroes (and villains) for Avengers: Infinity WarImage: Ryan Meinerding (Marvel Studios)This month, years of meticulous movie planning will culminate in the release of Avengers: Infinity War, smashing together heroes from a decade’s worth of some of the biggest films on the planet. The road to Infinity War has been paved with a decade of reporting around it—some of it leading to some very bizarre rumors that, unsurprisingly, weren’t true.The Chitauri, the ultimate villainous hordes of Avengers.Image: Marvel StudiosThe Skrulls Are the Threat That Will Bring the Avengers TogetherBack when the idea of something like Guardians of the Galaxy or Civil War were but twinkles in Kevin Feige’s eyes, and we somehow got excited by a meager six comic book characters teaming up—everyone turned to 2012's The Avengers to see what cataclysmic threat from the comics would finally unite the separate heroes of the fledgling MCU. At the top of the list: the Skrulls, the shapechanging alien warriors whose grand storyline in “Secret Invasion” was still relatively fresh in the minds of fans.The Skrulls were always unlikely—they were usually considered relatively off-limits in the Marvel movies due to several Skrull characters being part of Fox’s cache of movie rights. But also, “Secret Invasion” being introduced so early into the MCU would’ve been crazy, and a comics-fan pipe dream at most. That didn’t stop fans, though, who rapidly moved on to Badoon being the culprits (once again, Fox movie rights wrangling meant that was a no-go, too) until eventually it was revealed that the Chitauri would be Avengers’ horde of badguys. And... that was that. No one really cared in the end, anyway. It was all about the Avengers avenging things!Nova, aka Not Nathan Fillion.Image: Mike Deodato Jr. (Marvel Comics)Nathan Fillion Will Be NovaOh, Nathan Fillion, how many times have you been rumored to be joining the MCU in a major way? The first mention, however, will always be the greatest. When Guardians of the Galaxy was first in the works, rumors began swirling about the film’s inclusion of the Nova Corps, the Marvel Comics Universe’s group of cosmic supercops most famously known for being the group to which the hero Nova, a.k.a. Richard Rider, belonged. This led to the assumption Rider himself would be in the film alongside the rest of the Corps, and when rumors started swirling that former Firefly star Fillion was going to appear in the film, fans put two and a different two together and naturally assumed he had to be Nova. Even when James Gunn denied it, people still assumed Fillion would be a post-credit tease for future cosmic-bound Marvel films.But... he wasn’t. In fact, most people probably wouldn’t recognize Fillion in the final movie at all—he played one of the alien prisoners Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Gamora encounter in the Kyln, under heavy prostheses. Vol. 2 followed up with a cheeky set of posters casting Fillion as an actual Marvel superhero to make up for it: Simon Williams, the superhero-turned-actor Wonder Man. Coulson breathing his final breaths in Avengers... before he sneakily headed to ABC, that is.Image: Marvel StudiosPhil Coulson Will Become the VisionAgent Coulson’s untimely demise in the first Avengers movie led to all sorts of crazy rumors about how he’d make his way back to the land of the living (he would, but on TV for Agents of SHIELD, with an altogether more elaborate method for his resurrection). The craziest by far however was that Coulson’s body would become the form that the Vision, who would go on to debut in the Avengers sequel, would be based on. Which... is silly. Why would Vision adopt the form of a dead SHIELD agent? Why would Ultron randomly decide the face of Coulson should be the avatar of his vengeance against Tony Stark and the Avengers? Even Coulson himself, Gregg Clark, thought it was a bit nonsensical. Thankfully, as we now know, it wasn’t the case; Paul Bettany, who already provided the voice of Tony’s A.I. servant Jarvis, went on to play the Vision. But still, think of the complete weirdness Agents of SHIELD would’ve become if Gregg was running around in the Vision’s get-up.The original Captain Marvel on the cover of Secret Avengers #27.Image: Alan Davis (Marvel Comics)Star-Lord’s Dad Will Be the Original Captain MarvelThe unknown, cosmic identity of Star-Lord’s father plays a small role in his backstory in the first Guardians movie, and was a driving force behind the events of its sequel. When it was first announced that Peter’s dad would be a major character in the sequel—and that, unlike in the comics, it would not be the alien J’son of Spartax—rumors began flinging about as to who it might be before settling on Captain Marvel.No, not Carol Danvers—that would’ve been even weirder. This theory referred to Mar-Vell, the Kree supersoldier who was the first Captain Marvel in the comics, and whose powers were given to Carol in a freak accident, allowing her to become Ms. Marvel and eventually Captain Marvel herself. The first Guardians film had already introduced the Kree in the form of Ronan, and with confirmation of a Carol Danvers movie finally happening, the rumors seemed reasonable at first, even if still pretty out there. But at Comic-Con 2016 James Gunn once again denied rumors and instead revealed that Peter’s father would be Ego the Living Planet, known in the comics for being, well... a planet. With an ego.Actually, that one may have ended up even weirder than the Mar-Vell rumor.Carol suits up in the cover art for Captain Marvel #1's relaunch in 2014.Image: David Lopez (Marvel Comics)Meanwhile, Captain Marvel Will Be Showing Up... Basically EverywhereEven before her own movie was confirmed, rumors of Captain Marvel showing up all over the place in the MCU were constant. First there was talk that she would debut in Age of Ultron, only for Marvel to firmly deny it. Then, weirdly enough, the company revealed that there was a draft where Carol made her cameo debut in the film’s final scenes, but that was cut—and then revealed that Joss Whedon shot test footage to insert Carol into, but it was instead used for Scarlet Witch in the final film. Either way, no Captain Marvel so far.Most recently, of course, we have rumors of her involvement in Infinity War, which seem more and more unlikely by the day, especially with a few reports that she’ll instead show up in Avengers 4—so please continue waiting for Carol Danvers for now.The Vision, at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, not contemplating leaving the planet.Image: Marvel StudiosA Bummed-Out Vision Will Go to Space at the End of Civil WarGiven the ever-closer threat of Thanos in the MCU, and the fact that the Vision’s forehead houses one of the Infinity Stones the Titan covets, many fans have long believed the synthezoid superhero would eventually end up in the cosmic side of the Marvel movie-verse... and then very dead at Thanos’ hands. Then came an elaborate rumor ahead of Captain America: Civil War that suggested that Vision, dismayed by infighting among the Avengers, would simply float up and away off Earth during the climax of the movie, heading off into space to make possible appearances in the then-upcoming Guardians sequel or Thor: Ragnarok before meeting his untimely end before Infinity War. Thankfully, that never ended up being the case—and while we know Vision plays a hugely important role in Infinity War, he didn’t have to randomly blast into space to do so.Chris Evans as Captain America in the actual ending of Captain America: Civil War.Image: Marvel StudiosCaptain America: Civil War Shot Two Endings, Including One Where Captain America DiedTurns out that naming a Captain America movie after a comic book event that ends with Captain America being assassinated (he got better, it’s a long story) will lead to rumors that Captain America will croak in the movie version, no matter how wildly divergent from the comic book storylines the movies had already shown themselves to be by the time Civil War was hitting theaters. But it wasn’t the rumors of a Cap death that were themselves that surprising; after all, there was a solid basis for it in the comics. It only got weird when a rumor started getting around that Marvel was planning to shoot two very divergent paths for the MCU.Allegedly, the reports claimed, the Russo Brothers were preparing to direct two completely different endings for the movie. In one, Captain America ended the film on the run (as he did in the final movie). In the other, however, he surrendered to the Sokovia Accords, only to be assassinated, just as he was in the comics. In the end, though, this was complete bullshit—the Russos barely even considered taking the comic’s ending for the film.Ty Simpkins as Iron Man 3's Harley Keener. Helmet’s a bit big for him, don’t you think?Image: Marvel StudiosThat Kid From Iron Man 3 Will Be the New Iron ManAs it’s become public how much Marvel pays to keep Robert Downey Jr. in the Iron Man suit, people are getting increasingly interested/concerned about when the actor will inevitably leave the MCU. With Avengers: Infinity War representing a climax to the current status quo of the movie universe, it’s almost become accepted that this is likely the end for Tony Stark as we know him. So who could replace him? While the obvious answer is Rhodey, that rather logical assumption didn’t stop rumors from popping up on IMDB that Ty Simpkins, who played Harley, the young kid who Tony befriended in Iron Man 3, had joined the cast of Avengers 4 in an unspecified role. This naturally led to the assumption that he would somehow be replacing Tony as the new Iron Man, despite being a literal child. Sure, Avengers 4 isn’t actually out yet so who knows, but we’re pretty safe that li’l Harley won’t be putting on some armor in the post-Infinity War world."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli,"Virat Kohli ( pronunciation (help·info); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains the India national team. A right-handed batsman, Kohli is often regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world.[2] He plays for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the team's captain since 2013. Born and raised in Delhi, Kohli represented the city's cricket team at various age-group levels before making his first-class debut in 2006. He captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, and a few months later, made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of ""ODI specialist"" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[3] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[4] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). In 2014, he became the top-ranked T20I batsman in the ICC rankings, holding the position for three successive years till 2017. Since October 2017, he has also been the top-ranked ODI batsman in the world and is currently the 2nd ranked Test batsman in the world.[5] Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second highest number of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. Kohli holds numerous Indian batting records including the fastest ODI century, the fastest batsman to 5,000 ODI runs and the fastest to 10 ODI centuries. He is only the second batsman in the world to have scored 1,000 or more ODI runs for four consecutive calendar years.[6] Among the T20I world records held by Kohli are: the fastest batsman to 1,000 runs, most runs in a calendar year and most fifties in the format. He also holds the records of most runs in a single tournament of both the World Twenty20 and the IPL. He also has the highest historic rating points for an Indian batsman in ODIs (909 points)[7] and T20Is (897 points)[8] in ICC rankings and 2nd highest rating points in Tests (912 points) behind only Sunil Gavaskar.[9][10] He is the only batsman in history to average over 50 in Test matches, ODIs and T20Is simultaneously.[11] Kohli has been the recipient of many awards such as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2016, ICC World Cricketer of the Year in 2017, and ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and 2017. In 2013, he was given the Arjuna Award in recognition of his achievements in international cricket. The Padma Shri was conferred upon him in 2017 under the sports category.[12] Alongside his cricket career, Kohli co-owns FC Goa in the ISL, the IPTL franchise UAE Royals and the PWL team Bengaluru Yodhas. He also has other business ventures and over 20 brand endorsements. Kohli is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN[13] and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.[14] His brand value in 2016 was estimated to be US$92 million, placing him second on the list of India's most valued celebrity brands.[15] Early life Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi family.[16] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife.[17] He has an elder brother, Vikash, and an elder sister, Bhavna.[18] According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.[19] Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[20] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created, and Kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake.[20] Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that ""Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club"".[17] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[20] Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, ""He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and I was most impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn’t leave.""[21] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[17] Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as ""a bright and alert child"".[22] Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.[23] Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[17] Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, ""I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory.""[24] According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, ""My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to practice every day. I miss his presence sometimes.""[25] Youth and domestic career Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He was the leading run-getter for his team in that tournament with 172 runs at an average of 34.40.[26] He became the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy[27] and scored 390 runs in 5 innings at an average of 78 including two centuries and two fifties.[28] In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. He scored 470 runs in four matches at an average of 117.50 with two hundreds and top-score of 251*.[29] Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches at an average of 84.11 with two centuries.[30] In February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat.[31] In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[32] and 49 in the three-match Test series.[33] India Under-19 went on to win both the series. At the conclusion of the tour, the India Under-19 coach Lalchand Rajput was impressed with Kohli and said, ""Kohli showed strong technical skills against both pace and spin"".[34] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series[35] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.[36] ""The way I approached the game changed that day. I just had one thing in my mind - that I have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad."" “ ” — Kohli on his innings against Karnataka.[37] Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, at the age of 18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90.[38] He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, ""That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial,"" while coach Chetan Chauhan lauded Kohli's ""attitude and determination.""[39] His mother noted that ""Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his own too.""[17] He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.[40] In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[41] In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs from 5 matches.[42] In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a hundred and a fifty.[43] ""He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill."" “ ” — India's coach at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup Dav Whatmore on Kohli.[37] In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. Batting at number 4, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament.[44] His century (100 runs from 74 balls) against the West Indies Under-19s in the group stage, which was called ""the innings of the tournament"" by ESPNcricinfo,[45] gave India a 50-run victory and earned Kohli the man of the match. Kohli picked up a leg injury during the match, but recovered in time to play the quarterfinal match against England Under-19s.[46] He was instrumental in India's three-wicket semifinal win over New Zealand Under-19s in which he took 2/27 and scored 43 in the tense run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.[47] He scored 19 against South Africa Under-19s in the final which India won by 12 runs (D/L method). ESPNcricinfo commended him for making several tactical bowling changes during the tournament.[45] Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract.[48] In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[44] In July 2008, he was included in India's 30-man probable squad for the ICC Champions Trophy which was to be held in Pakistan in September 2008.[49] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in Australia. He was in fine form in that tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[50] International career Early years In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches,[51] and his selection was called a ""surprise call-up"".[52] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series. He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[53] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match which helped India win the series.[53] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches.[53] India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. After the Champions Trophy was postponed to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[54] He batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings.[55] Later that month in September 2008, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197. The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead.[56] In October 2008, Kohli played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia. He made 105 and 16* in that match against a bowling line-up consisting of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza.[57] Kohli was included in the squad for the home ODI series against England in November 2008 but was not given a chance to play, due to the inclusion of Tendulkar and Sehwag in the team.[58] In December 2008, Kohli was given a Grade D contract in the annual BCCI contracts list which entitled him to receive Rs 15 lakh.[59] He was then dropped from the squad for the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka in January 2009. Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in July–August 2009 held in Australia. He opened the innings for India Emerging Players in that tournament and finished as the leading run-getter with 398 runs from seven matches at an average of 66.33.[60] He scored 104 off 102 balls in the final against South Africa Emerging Players at Brisbane to help his team win the match by 17 runs and clinch the title.[61] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the national selection committee, was impressed with Kohli and remarked ""I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability.""[62] Kohli has called this tournament as the ""turning point"" of his career.[63] Kohli returned to the national team replacing the injured Gambhir in Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[64] He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh. In the inconsequential group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award.[65] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches as injury replacement. He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[66] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 111 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[53] The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli.[67] Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010, which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches. Against Bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297.[53] In the next match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33 overs. The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs.[68] He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina.[69] Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series[63][70] in particular by the Indian captain Dhoni.[71] Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat,[53] he finished as the leading run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66.[72] In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.[53] Rise through the ranks Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May–June 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour. Kohli made 168 runs at 42.00 including two fifties,[73] but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket.[74] He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26.[75] Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in a full-strength Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[76] His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15. Kohli batting in an ODI against New Zealand in December 2010 Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October, and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early.[77] Winning the man of the match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series.[78] Part of a largely inexperienced team for the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in the first game,[79] and followed it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches.[53] India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team[80] and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[81] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries.[82] Kohli was India's leading run-getter in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[83] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for ODI batsmen,[84] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[85] The inclusion of both Kohli and Raina in the World Cup squad resulted in speculations about which of the two batsmen will make it to the playing eleven. Days before India's first match of the tournament, Indian captain Dhoni indicated that the in-form Kohli is likely to be preferred over Raina.[84] Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth ODI century, in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[86] In the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against England, Ireland, Netherlands and South Africa respectively. Having returned to form with 59 against the West Indies, he scored only 24 and 9 in the quarterfinal against Australia and semifinal against Pakistan respectively.[53] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275.[87] This partnership is regarded as ""one of the turning points in the match"",[88] as India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 1983.[89] Kohli fielding during a match in December 2010 When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they chose a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar and others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missing out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[90] Kohli found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80.[91] His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory,[92] and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat.[53] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5 and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind by Fidel Edwards in both innings.[93] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[94] struggling against the short ball[95] and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series.[96] Initially dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August, Kohli was recalled as replacement for the injured Yuvraj,[97] though did not play in any match in the series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[98] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[53] In the last game of the series, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid, who was playing his last ODI, to help India post their first 300-plus total of the tour.[99] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his ""hard work"" and ""maturity"".[100] However, England won the match by D/L method and the series 3–0. In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run-scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches including unbeaten knocks of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209-run partnership with Gambhir,[101] and 86 at Mumbai, both in successful run-chases.[53] Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included, ahead of Raina, in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. In competition with Yuvraj Singh for the number six position,[102] it was not until the final match of the series that Kohli was selected in the team. He scored a pair of fifties in the match,[93] with his first innings score of 52 ensuring India avoided follow-on.[103] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[104] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run-chase of 271,[105] a knock which raised his reputation as ""an expert of the chase"".[106] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 and four centuries.[107] Ascension to ODI vice-captaincy Having found a place in India's Test squad for the tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli top-scored with 132 in a tour match against Cricket Australia Chairman's XI to strengthen his case for a spot in the playing eleven ahead of Rohit Sharma.[108] Batting at number 6, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed.[109][93] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat.[110] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series.[111] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as ""the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists"".[112] Kohli fielding during a CB Series match against Australia in February 2012 In the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane–both against Sri Lanka.[53] India registered two wins, a tie and four losses in these seven matches, which meant that they needed a bonus point win their last group match against Sri Lanka at Hobart, to stay in contention for qualifying for the finals series.[113] Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare.[114] India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock, which included scoring 24 runs in an over by Lasith Malinga.[115] Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as ""one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time"".[116] However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series.[117] With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli once again finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.[118] Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performance in Australia. Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, ""Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. We have to start looking towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material.""[119] Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119.[120] He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory,[121] while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66.[53] In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time.[122][123] His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara.[124] Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament. In July–August 2012, Kohli struck two centuries in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka–106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo–winning man of the match in both games.[125][126] India won the series 4–1 and on account of scoring the most number of runs in the series, Kohli was named player of the series.[127] In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and won the player of the series award.[128] Kohli scored his second Test century at Bangalore during New Zealand's tour of India and won his first man of the match award in Test cricket.[129] India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli averaged 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings.[130] In the subsequent T20I series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but India lost the match by one run and the series 1–0.[75] He continued to be in good form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs from 5 matches at an average of 46.25.[131] He hit two fifties during the tournament, 50 against Afghanistan in the group stage[132] and 78* against Pakistan in the Super Eights, winning man of the match for both innings.[133] Kohli's Test form dipped during the first three matches of England's tour of India with a top score of 20 and England leading the series 2–1.[93] He scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match on a slow and low pitch at Nagpur,[134] keeping India in contention of drawing the series. ESPNcricinfo praised Kohli for having ""demonstrated his growing maturity to play just the sort of innings his side required"",[135] while Kohli described his knock as ""a learning innings"".[136] However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years.[137] Against Pakistan in December 2012, Kohli averaged 18 in the T20Is[138] and 4.33 in the ODIs,[139] being troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan, who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series.[140] Kohli had a quiet ODI series against England, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third ODI at Ranchi,[141] with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75.[142] ""I love watching Virat Kohli bat. He looks to me like an individual of my own heart. I love his aggression, and [he has] serious passion that I used to have. He reminds me of myself."" “ ” — Former West Indies captain Sir Viv Richards on Kohli.[143] Kohli scored his fourth Test century (107) at Chennai in the first match of the home Test series against Australia in February 2013. He said he was ""feeling hungry for this series"" after a poor run of form in the two previous series and also disappointed on getting out soon after reaching the hundred-run mark.[144] India completed a 4–0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash Australia in more than four decades.[145] Kohli averaged 56.80 in the series and cemented his spot in the Test team.[146] Setting records Kohli batting against South Africa at Cardiff during the Champions Trophy in June 2013 In June 2013, Kohli featured in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won. He scored a match-winning 144 against Sri Lanka in a warm-up match.[147] He scored 34, 22 and 22 not out in India's group matches against South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan respectively, while India qualified for the semifinals with an undefeated record. In the semifinal against Sri Lanka at Cardiff, he struck 58 not out in an eight-wicket win for India.[53] The final between India and England at Birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. India batted first and Kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 balls, sharing a sixth-wicket partnership of 47 runs off 33 balls with Ravindra Jadeja and helping India reach 129/7 in 20 overs. India went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory.[148] Kohli stood-in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with Kohli being named captain for the remaining matches.[149] In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first hundred as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India.[150] Many senior players including Dhoni were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, with Kohli being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time.[151] In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award.[152] He batted on two more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 58 not out. India completed a 5–0 sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI series.[153] Kohli had a successful time with the bat in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at Pune, he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with Rohit Sharma that came in 17.2 overs,[154] Kohli's innings of 100 not out helped India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of one wicket with more than six overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket, while Kohli's knock became the fastest hundred against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase.[155] He followed that innings with 68 in the next match at Mohali in another Indian defeat,[53] before the next two matches were washed out by rain. In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won the man of the match.[156] He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket.[157] India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings for the first time in his career.[4] Kohli batted twice in the two-match Test series against the West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being dismissed by Shane Shillingford in both innings. This was also the last Test series for Tendulkar and Kohli was expected to take Tendulkar's number 4 batting position after the series.[158] In the first game of the three-match ODI series that followed at Kochi, Kohli made 86 to seal a six-wicket win and won the man of the match.[159] During the match, he also equalled Viv Richards' record of becoming the fastest batsman to make 5,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the landmark in his 114th innings.[160] He missed out on his third century at Visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for 99 playing a hook shot off Ravi Rampaul.[161] India lost the match by two wickets, but took the series 2–1 after winning the last match at Kanpur.[162] With 204 runs at 68.00, Kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was awarded the man of the series.[163] Overseas season India toured South Africa in December 2013 for three ODIs and two Tests. Kohli averaged 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck.[164] In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa[165] and batting at 4 for the first time,[93] Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998.[166] Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, ""The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. I think he [Kohli] showed great discipline and responsibility. It reminds me of Sachin Tendulkar when they came here in 1996.""[167] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match.[168] India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.[93] ""Kohli is the next chosen one. He exudes the intensity of Dravid, the audacity of Sehwag, and the extraordinary range of Tendulkar. That doesn't make him better, simply sui generis, his own unique kind."" “ ” — Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe on Kohli.[169] Kohli continued to amass runs on the subsequent New Zealand tour. He averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series[170] in which his efforts of 111-ball 123 at Napier, 65-ball 78 at Hamilton and 78-ball 82 at Wellington[53] all went in vain as India were defeated 4–0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed[171] including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the match.[172] India then travelled to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni was ruled out of the Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named captain for the tournament.[173] Kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a 213-run third-wicket stand with Ajinkya Rahane, which helped India successfully chase 280.[174] It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh.[175] India were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, in which Kohli scored 48 and 5 respectively.[53] Dhoni returned from injury to captain the team for 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and Kohli was named vice-captain. In India's opening match of the tournament against Pakistan, Kohli top-scored with 36 not out to guide India to a seven-wicket win. He scored 54 off 41 balls in the next game against West Indies and an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls against Bangladesh, both in successful run-chases.[75] In the semifinal, he made an unbeaten 72 in 44 deliveries to help India achieve the target of 173 with six wickets and five balls to spare.[176] He won the man of the match for this knock which he called ""my best T20 innings"".[177] India posted 130/4 in the final against Sri Lanka, in which Kohli scored 77 from 58 balls, and eventually lost the match by six wickets.[178] Kohli had made a total of 319 runs in the tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single World Twenty20 tournament,[179] for which he won the Man of the Tournament award.[178] Kohli and other senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh ahead of the England tour. India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading it 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series averaging just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39.[180] He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging the ball to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times,[181] while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers.[182][183] Geoffrey Boycott said, ""Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He is playing with his bat too far away from his pad. He has to look at video replays of his technique and get back to basics"".[184] India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings.[185] In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour.[75] India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings.[186] Kohli had a successful time during India's home ODI series win over the West Indies in October 2014. His 62 in the second ODI at Delhi was his first fifty across Tests and ODIs in 16 innings since February,[187] and he stated that he got his ""confidence back"" with the innings.[188] He struck his 20th ODI hundred–127 runs in 114 balls–in the fourth match at Dharamsala. India registered a 59-run victory and Kohli was awarded man of the match.[189] Dhoni was rested for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in November, enabling Kohli to lead the team for another full series. Kohli batted at 4 throughout the series and made scores of 22, 49, 53 and 66 in the first four ODIs, with India leading the series 4–0. In the fifth ODI at Ranchi, Kohli came in to bat with India at 14/2 in pursuit of 287. He made an unbeaten 139 off 126 balls to give his team a three-wicket win and a whitewash of Sri Lanka.[190] Kohli was awarded player of the series, and it was the second whitewash under his captaincy.[191] During the series he became the fastest batsman in the world to go past the 6000-run mark in ODIs.[192] With 1054 ODI runs at 58.55 in 2014, he became the second player in the world after Sourav Ganguly to make more than 1,000 runs in ODIs for four consecutive calendar years.[6] Test captaincy For the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time.[193] Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut.[194] In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli came in to bat when the Indian innings was reduced to 57/2 and started batting aggressively. He put on 185 runs for the third wicket with M Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score.[195] Kohli noted that his team was looking for a win and not a draw, while also saying that it was ""the best Test I have been part of"".[196] Kohli's second innings ton was hailed by several Australian commentators as the finest fourth-innings performance they had ever seen in Australia.[197] Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India.[93] In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings. He made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years.[198] Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match.[93] Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.[199] Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain.[200] He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung in for another draw.[201] Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.[200] In January 2015, India failed to win a single match in the tri-nation ODI series against the hosts Australia and England. Kohli was unable to replicate his Test success in ODIs, failing to make a two-digit score in any of the four games.[53] Kohli's ODI form did not improve in the lead-up to the World Cup, with scores of 18 and 5 in the warm-up matches against Australia and Afghanistan respectively. Kohli batting against UAE at Perth during a group stage match of the 2015 World Cup In the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide, Kohli hit 107 in 126 balls, sharing 100-plus partnerships with both Dhawan and Raina, to help India set a total of 300 and win the match by 76 runs. For his knock, he was awarded the man of the match award, his 20th in ODIs and first in a World Cup match.[202] He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa after another century partnership with opening batsman Dhawan. India went on to post 307 in 50 overs and register a 130-run victory in the match. India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33, 44* and 38 against UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively.[53] India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record.[203] In India's 109-run victory in the quarterfinal over Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain for 3 edging the ball to the wicket-keeper. India was eliminated in the semifinal by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short-pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson.[53] Kohli had a slump in form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test which ended in a draw and averaged 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1.[204] Kohli ended his streak of low scores by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India came back and won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years.[205] During South Africa's tour of India, Kohli became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000 runs in T20I cricket, reaching the milestone in his 27th innings.[206] In the ODI series, he made 77 at Rajkot and a match-winning 138 in the fourth ODI at Chennai that helped India draw level in the series.[207] India lost the series after a defeat in the final ODI and Kohli finished the series with an average of 49.[208] India came back to beat the top-ranked South African team 3–0 in the four-match Test series under Kohli's captaincy, and climbed to number two position on the ICC Test rankings.[209] He scored a total of 200 runs in the series at 33.33, including 44 and 88 in the fourth match at Delhi.[93] No. 1 Test team and limited-overs captaincy Kohli started 2016 with scores of 91 and 59 in the first two ODIs of the limited-overs tour of Australia. He followed it up with a pair of hundreds–a run-a-ball 117 at Melbourne and 106 from 92 balls at Canberra–in the next two matches. During the course of the series, he became the fastest batsman in the world to cross the 7000-run mark in ODIs, getting to the milestone in his 161st innings, and the fastest to get to 25 centuries. After the ODI series ended in a 1–4 loss, the Indian team came back to whitewash the Australians 3–0 in the T20I series. Kohli made fifties in all three T20Is with scores of 90 not out,[210] 59 not out[211] and 50, winning two man of the matches as well as the man of the series award.[212] He was also instrumental in India winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh the following month in which he scored 49 in a run-chase of 84 against Pakistan,[213] followed by an unbeaten 56 against Sri Lanka and 41 not out in the Final against Bangladesh in two more successful chases.[214] Kohli maintained his match-winning form in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India, scoring 55 not out in another successful run-chase against Pakistan.[215] He struck an unbeaten 82 from 51 balls in India's must-win group match against Australia in ""an innings of sheer class"" with ""clean cricket shots"".[216][217] The knock helped India win by six wickets and register a spot in the semifinal; Kohli went on to rate the innings as his best in the format.[218] In the semifinal, Kohli top-scored once again with an unbeaten 89 from 47 deliveries, but West Indies overhauled India's total of 192 and ended India's campaign. His total of 273 runs in five matches at an average of 136.50 earned him his second consecutive Man of the Tournament award at the World Twenty20.[219] Playing his first Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 in the first Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in first-class cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests.[220] India went on to wrap the series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings.[221] In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali.[222] He then made 65 in the series-deciding fifth game at Visakhapatnam which India won. Kohli got double centuries in the next two Test series against England and Bangladesh, making him the first batsman ever to score double centuries in four consecutive series. He broke the record of Australian great Donald Bradman and Indian Rahul Dravid, both of whom had managed to get three. Against England, he got his then-highest Test score of 235.[223] He followed it up with ODI centuries against the West Indies and Sri Lanka in consecutive series, equalling Ricky Ponting's tally of 30 ODI centuries.[224][225][226] In October 2017, he was adjourned the ODI player of the series against New Zealand for scoring two ODI centuries, during the course of which he made a new record for the most runs (8,888), best average (55.55) and highest number of centuries (31) for any batsman when completing 200 ODIs.[227][228] Kohli made several more records during the 3 match Test series against Sri Lanka at home in November. After scoring a century and a double century in the first two Tests, he ended up scoring yet another double century in the third Test, during which he became the eleventh Indian batsman to surpass 5000 runs in Test cricket while scoring his 20th Test century and 6th double century.[229] During this match he also became the first batsman to score six double hundreds as a captain.[230] With 610 runs in the series, Kohli also became the highest run-scorer by an Indian in a three-match Test series and the fourth-highest overall.[231] India comfortably won the three-match series 1–0 and Kohli was adjudged man of the match for the second and third Test matches and player of the series. With this win, India equalled Australia for the record streak of nine consecutive series wins in Test cricket.[232] He ended the year with 2818 international runs, which is recorded as the third-highest tally ever in a calendar year and the highest tally ever by an Indian player.[231] Kohli fared average in the test matches as India lost 0-2 during the South Africa tour in January–February of 2018, but came back strongly to score 558 runs in the 6 ODIs, making a record for the highest runs scored in a bilateral ODI series.[233] This included three centuries, remaining unbeaten in two with a best of 160*.[234] India won the ODI series 5-1, Kohli becoming the first Indian captain to win an ODI series South Africa.[235] In March 2018, Kohli decided to play county cricket in England in June, in order to improve his batting before the start of India's tour to England the following month.[236][237] Indian Premier League In March 2008, Kohli was bought on a youth contract by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000. He had an indifferent 2008 season, with a total of 165 runs in 12 innings at an average of 15.00 and a strike rate of 105.09.[238] He fared slightly better in the second season in which he made a total of 246 runs at 22.36, striking at over 112, while his team made it as far as the final.[239] In the 2010 season, Kohli was the third highest run-getter for his team with 307 runs, averaging 27.90 and improving his strike rate to 144.81.[240] Ahead of the 2011 season, Kohli was the only player retained by the Royal Challengers franchise. Kohli was made vice-captain of the team that year and also captained the team in a few matches when the regular skipper Daniel Vettori was injured. The Royal Challengers coach Ray Jennings opined that the 22-year-old would become the future captain of not only the franchise but also the Indian team.[241] Kohli was the second-highest run-getter of the season, only behind teammate Chris Gayle, and his team finished as runners-up of the IPL. Kohli accumulated a total of 557 runs at an average of 46.41 and a strike rate of over 121 including four fifties.[242] In the 2012 IPL, he was moderately successful, averaging 28 for his 364 runs.[243] After Vettori's retirement, Kohli was appointed as the team's captain for the 2013 season. The Royal Challengers finished fifth on the league table that year, but Kohli found success with the bat. Averaging 45.28, he hit a total of 634 runs at a strike rate of over 138 including six fifties and a top-score of 99 and finished as the season's third-highest run-scorer.[244] Bangalore finished seventh in the next season in which Kohli made 359 runs at 27.61.[245] He found success with the bat in the 2015 IPL in which he led his team to the playoffs. He finished fifth on the season's leading run-getters list with 505 runs at an average of 45.90 and a strike rate of more than 130.[246] At the 2016 IPL, the Royal Challengers finished runners-up and Kohli broke the record for most runs in an IPL season (of 733 runs) by scoring 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08, winning the Orange Cap. He scored four centuries in the tournament, having never scored one in the Twenty20 format before the start of the season, and also became the first player to reach the 4000-run milestone in the IPL. At the launch event of his biography, 'Driven: The Virat Kohli Story' in New Delhi, in October 2016, Kohli announced that RCB would be the IPL franchise that he would permanently play for.[247] Kohli missed the start of the 2017 season due to a shoulder injury. Morever, RCB finished the tournament at the bottom of the table, with Kohli scoring the most runs for his team, with 308 from 10 matches. In the 2018 season, Kohli was retained by RCB for a price tag of 17 crore, the highest for anybody that year. Playing style Kohli is a naturally aggressive batsman[37] with strong technical skills.[248] He usually bats in the middle-order, but, on many occasions, has opened the innings as well. He bats with a slightly open-chested stance[249][250] and a strong bottom-hand grip,[251][252] and is said to have quick footwork.[253] He is known for his wide range of shots, ability to pace an innings and batting under pressure.[254][255][256] He is strong through the mid-wicket and cover region.[257] He has said that the cover drive is his favourite shot, while also saying that the flick shot comes naturally to him.[19] He does not play the sweep shot often, being called ""not a natural sweeper of the cricket ball"".[258] His teammates have praised his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethics.[259][260][261] Kohli is also known to be a ""sharp"" fielder.[262][263] Kohli is regarded as the best limited-overs batsmen in the world, especially while chasing.[264][265] In ODIs, he averages more than 67 in matches batting second as opposed to around 47 batting first.[266] 21 of his 35 ODI hundreds have come in run-chases and he holds the record for most hundreds batting second.[267] Regarding his impressive record batting second, Kohli has said ""I love the whole situation that comes with chasing. I like the challenge of testing myself, figuring out how to rotate strike, when to hit a boundary.""[19] Kohli is often compared to Sachin Tendulkar, due to their similar styles of batting, and sometimes referred to as Tendulkar's ""successor"".[158][167] Many former cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records.[268][269] Kohli has stated that growing up his idol and role model was Tendulkar and that as a kid he ""tried to copy the shots [Tendulkar] played and hit sixes the way he used to hit them.""[270] Former West Indies great Vivian Richards, who is regarded as the most destructive batsman in cricket, stated that Kohli reminds him of himself.[143] In early 2015, Richards said Kohli was ""already legendary"" in the ODI format,[271] while former Australian cricketer Dean Jones called Kohli the ""new king of world cricket"".[272] Kohli is noted for his on-field aggression and was described in the media as ""brash"" and ""arrogant"" during his early career.[261][273] He has got into confrontations with players and umpires on several occasions.[261][274] While many former cricketers have backed his aggressive attitude,[275][276][277] some have criticised it.[261][278] In 2012, Kohli had stated that he tries to limit his aggressive behaviour but ""the build-up and the pressure or the special occasions make it tough to control the aggression.""[279] International centuries As of April 2018[update], Kohli has scored 21 Test centuries and 35 ODI centuries.

He used to wear black wristbands as a cricket superstition; earlier, he used to wear the same pair of gloves with which he had ""been scoring"". Apart from a religious black thread, he has also been wearing a kara on his right arm since 2012.[335] Commercial investments According to Kohli, football is his second favourite sport.[336] In 2014, Kohli became a co-owner of Indian Super League club FC Goa. He stated that he invested in the club with the ""keenness of football"" and because he ""wanted football to grow in India"".[337] He added, ""It's a business venture for me for the future.

In 2015, Kohli invested 90 crore (US$14 million) to start a chain of gyms and fitness centres across the country. Launched under the name Chisel, the chain of gyms is jointly owned by Kohli, Chisel India and CSE (Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment), the agency which manages Kohli's commercial interests.[341] In 2016, Kohli started Stepathlon Kids, a children fitness venture, in partnership with Stepathlon Lifestyle.[342] Endorsements Kohli was signed up by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh recalls, ""I didn’t go after them after they became stars. In fact, I watched Virat at the 2008 ICC Under-19 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur. I was mighty impressed with his attitude and the way he was marshalling his team. He had that spark. And I told Yuvi to set up the meeting.""[343] Sajdeh manages Kohli's endorsement deals, along with those of other Indian cricketers Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Murali Vijay. It was reported in 2013 that Kohli's brand endorsements were worth over 100 crore.[344] His bat deal with MRF is said to be the costliest deal in Indian cricket history.[343] In 2017, he signed an eight-year endorsement deal with Puma worth about 110 crore, becoming the first Indian sportsperson to sign a 100 crore deal with a brand.[345] In 2014, American Appraisal estimated Kohli's brand value at US$56.4 million placing him fourth on the list of India's most valued celebrity brands.[346] The same year, UK-based magazine SportsPro rated Kohli as the second most marketable athlete in the world behind only Lewis Hamilton, placing him above the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Usain Bolt.[347] In an October 2016 report by Duff & Phelps on India's most valued celebrity brands, Kohli's brand value was estimated to be US$92 million, second only to that of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.[15] In 2017, Kohli was ranked 7th in the list released by Forbes as the Most Valuable Brand among athletes ahead of players like Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy and Stephen Curry with an estimated brand value of $14.5 million.[348] As of September 2017, Kohli has endorsement deals with 17 brands.[349] The brands Kohli previously endorsed include 3C Company, Celkon Mobiles, Cinthol (from Godrej), Clear (from Unilever), Fair & Lovely, Fastrack (from Titan), Pepsi, Flying Machine, Mattel, Munch (from Nestle), Oakley, Red Chief Shoes, Royal Challenge (from United Breweries), Sangam Suitings and Toyota Motors.[350][351][352] Charity Kohli at a VKF charity event in June 2016 In March 2013, Kohli started a charity foundation called Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli,"Virat Kohli ( pronunciation (help·info); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains the India national team. A right-handed batsman, Kohli is often regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world.[2] He plays for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the team's captain since 2013. Born and raised in Delhi, Kohli represented the city's cricket team at various age-group levels before making his first-class debut in 2006. He captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, and a few months later, made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of ""ODI specialist"" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[3] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[4] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). In 2014, he became the top-ranked T20I batsman in the ICC rankings, holding the position for three successive years till 2017. Since October 2017, he has also been the top-ranked ODI batsman in the world and is currently the 2nd ranked Test batsman in the world.[5] Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second highest number of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. Kohli holds numerous Indian batting records including the fastest ODI century, the fastest batsman to 5,000 ODI runs and the fastest to 10 ODI centuries. He is only the second batsman in the world to have scored 1,000 or more ODI runs for four consecutive calendar years.[6] Among the T20I world records held by Kohli are: the fastest batsman to 1,000 runs, most runs in a calendar year and most fifties in the format. He also holds the records of most runs in a single tournament of both the World Twenty20 and the IPL. He also has the highest historic rating points for an Indian batsman in ODIs (909 points)[7] and T20Is (897 points)[8] in ICC rankings and 2nd highest rating points in Tests (912 points) behind only Sunil Gavaskar.[9][10] He is the only batsman in history to average over 50 in Test matches, ODIs and T20Is simultaneously.[11] Kohli has been the recipient of many awards such as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2016, ICC World Cricketer of the Year in 2017, and ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and 2017. In 2013, he was given the Arjuna Award in recognition of his achievements in international cricket. The Padma Shri was conferred upon him in 2017 under the sports category.[12] Alongside his cricket career, Kohli co-owns FC Goa in the ISL, the IPTL franchise UAE Royals and the PWL team Bengaluru Yodhas. He also has other business ventures and over 20 brand endorsements. Kohli is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN[13] and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.[14] His brand value in 2016 was estimated to be US$92 million, placing him second on the list of India's most valued celebrity brands.[15] Early life Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi family.[16] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife.[17] He has an elder brother, Vikash, and an elder sister, Bhavna.[18] According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.[19] Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[20] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created, and Kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake.[20] Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that ""Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club"".[17] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[20] Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, ""He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and I was most impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn’t leave.""[21] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[17] Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as ""a bright and alert child"".[22] Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.[23] Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[17] Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, ""I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory.""[24] According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, ""My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to practice every day. I miss his presence sometimes.""[25] Youth and domestic career Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He was the leading run-getter for his team in that tournament with 172 runs at an average of 34.40.[26] He became the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy[27] and scored 390 runs in 5 innings at an average of 78 including two centuries and two fifties.[28] In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. He scored 470 runs in four matches at an average of 117.50 with two hundreds and top-score of 251*.[29] Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches at an average of 84.11 with two centuries.[30] In February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat.[31] In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[32] and 49 in the three-match Test series.[33] India Under-19 went on to win both the series. At the conclusion of the tour, the India Under-19 coach Lalchand Rajput was impressed with Kohli and said, ""Kohli showed strong technical skills against both pace and spin"".[34] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series[35] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.[36] ""The way I approached the game changed that day. I just had one thing in my mind - that I have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad."" “ ” — Kohli on his innings against Karnataka.[37] Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, at the age of 18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90.[38] He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, ""That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial,"" while coach Chetan Chauhan lauded Kohli's ""attitude and determination.""[39] His mother noted that ""Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his own too.""[17] He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.[40] In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[41] In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs from 5 matches.[42] In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a hundred and a fifty.[43] ""He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill."" “ ” — India's coach at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup Dav Whatmore on Kohli.[37] In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. Batting at number 4, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament.[44] His century (100 runs from 74 balls) against the West Indies Under-19s in the group stage, which was called ""the innings of the tournament"" by ESPNcricinfo,[45] gave India a 50-run victory and earned Kohli the man of the match. Kohli picked up a leg injury during the match, but recovered in time to play the quarterfinal match against England Under-19s.[46] He was instrumental in India's three-wicket semifinal win over New Zealand Under-19s in which he took 2/27 and scored 43 in the tense run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.[47] He scored 19 against South Africa Under-19s in the final which India won by 12 runs (D/L method). ESPNcricinfo commended him for making several tactical bowling changes during the tournament.[45] Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract.[48] In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[44] In July 2008, he was included in India's 30-man probable squad for the ICC Champions Trophy which was to be held in Pakistan in September 2008.[49] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in Australia. He was in fine form in that tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[50] International career Early years In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches,[51] and his selection was called a ""surprise call-up"".[52] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series. He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[53] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match which helped India win the series.[53] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches.[53] India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. After the Champions Trophy was postponed to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[54] He batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings.[55] Later that month in September 2008, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197. The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead.[56] In October 2008, Kohli played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia. He made 105 and 16* in that match against a bowling line-up consisting of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza.[57] Kohli was included in the squad for the home ODI series against England in November 2008 but was not given a chance to play, due to the inclusion of Tendulkar and Sehwag in the team.[58] In December 2008, Kohli was given a Grade D contract in the annual BCCI contracts list which entitled him to receive Rs 15 lakh.[59] He was then dropped from the squad for the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka in January 2009. Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in July–August 2009 held in Australia. He opened the innings for India Emerging Players in that tournament and finished as the leading run-getter with 398 runs from seven matches at an average of 66.33.[60] He scored 104 off 102 balls in the final against South Africa Emerging Players at Brisbane to help his team win the match by 17 runs and clinch the title.[61] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the national selection committee, was impressed with Kohli and remarked ""I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability.""[62] Kohli has called this tournament as the ""turning point"" of his career.[63] Kohli returned to the national team replacing the injured Gambhir in Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[64] He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh. In the inconsequential group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award.[65] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches as injury replacement. He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[66] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 111 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[53] The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli.[67] Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010, which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches. Against Bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297.[53] In the next match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33 overs. The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs.[68] He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina.[69] Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series[63][70] in particular by the Indian captain Dhoni.[71] Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat,[53] he finished as the leading run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66.[72] In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.[53] Rise through the ranks Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May–June 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour. Kohli made 168 runs at 42.00 including two fifties,[73] but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket.[74] He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26.[75] Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in a full-strength Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[76] His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15. Kohli batting in an ODI against New Zealand in December 2010 Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October, and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early.[77] Winning the man of the match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series.[78] Part of a largely inexperienced team for the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in the first game,[79] and followed it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches.[53] India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team[80] and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[81] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries.[82] Kohli was India's leading run-getter in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[83] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for ODI batsmen,[84] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[85] The inclusion of both Kohli and Raina in the World Cup squad resulted in speculations about which of the two batsmen will make it to the playing eleven. Days before India's first match of the tournament, Indian captain Dhoni indicated that the in-form Kohli is likely to be preferred over Raina.[84] Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth ODI century, in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[86] In the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against England, Ireland, Netherlands and South Africa respectively. Having returned to form with 59 against the West Indies, he scored only 24 and 9 in the quarterfinal against Australia and semifinal against Pakistan respectively.[53] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275.[87] This partnership is regarded as ""one of the turning points in the match"",[88] as India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 1983.[89] Kohli fielding during a match in December 2010 When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they chose a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar and others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missing out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[90] Kohli found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80.[91] His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory,[92] and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat.[53] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5 and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind by Fidel Edwards in both innings.[93] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[94] struggling against the short ball[95] and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series.[96] Initially dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August, Kohli was recalled as replacement for the injured Yuvraj,[97] though did not play in any match in the series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[98] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[53] In the last game of the series, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid, who was playing his last ODI, to help India post their first 300-plus total of the tour.[99] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his ""hard work"" and ""maturity"".[100] However, England won the match by D/L method and the series 3–0. In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run-scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches including unbeaten knocks of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209-run partnership with Gambhir,[101] and 86 at Mumbai, both in successful run-chases.[53] Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included, ahead of Raina, in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. In competition with Yuvraj Singh for the number six position,[102] it was not until the final match of the series that Kohli was selected in the team. He scored a pair of fifties in the match,[93] with his first innings score of 52 ensuring India avoided follow-on.[103] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[104] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run-chase of 271,[105] a knock which raised his reputation as ""an expert of the chase"".[106] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 and four centuries.[107] Ascension to ODI vice-captaincy Having found a place in India's Test squad for the tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli top-scored with 132 in a tour match against Cricket Australia Chairman's XI to strengthen his case for a spot in the playing eleven ahead of Rohit Sharma.[108] Batting at number 6, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed.[109][93] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat.[110] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series.[111] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as ""the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists"".[112] Kohli fielding during a CB Series match against Australia in February 2012 In the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane–both against Sri Lanka.[53] India registered two wins, a tie and four losses in these seven matches, which meant that they needed a bonus point win their last group match against Sri Lanka at Hobart, to stay in contention for qualifying for the finals series.[113] Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare.[114] India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock, which included scoring 24 runs in an over by Lasith Malinga.[115] Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as ""one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time"".[116] However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series.[117] With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli once again finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.[118] Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performance in Australia. Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, ""Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. We have to start looking towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material.""[119] Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119.[120] He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory,[121] while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66.[53] In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time.[122][123] His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara.[124] Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament. In July–August 2012, Kohli struck two centuries in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka–106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo–winning man of the match in both games.[125][126] India won the series 4–1 and on account of scoring the most number of runs in the series, Kohli was named player of the series.[127] In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and won the player of the series award.[128] Kohli scored his second Test century at Bangalore during New Zealand's tour of India and won his first man of the match award in Test cricket.[129] India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli averaged 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings.[130] In the subsequent T20I series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but India lost the match by one run and the series 1–0.[75] He continued to be in good form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs from 5 matches at an average of 46.25.[131] He hit two fifties during the tournament, 50 against Afghanistan in the group stage[132] and 78* against Pakistan in the Super Eights, winning man of the match for both innings.[133] Kohli's Test form dipped during the first three matches of England's tour of India with a top score of 20 and England leading the series 2–1.[93] He scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match on a slow and low pitch at Nagpur,[134] keeping India in contention of drawing the series. ESPNcricinfo praised Kohli for having ""demonstrated his growing maturity to play just the sort of innings his side required"",[135] while Kohli described his knock as ""a learning innings"".[136] However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years.[137] Against Pakistan in December 2012, Kohli averaged 18 in the T20Is[138] and 4.33 in the ODIs,[139] being troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan, who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series.[140] Kohli had a quiet ODI series against England, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third ODI at Ranchi,[141] with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75.[142] ""I love watching Virat Kohli bat. He looks to me like an individual of my own heart. I love his aggression, and [he has] serious passion that I used to have. He reminds me of myself."" “ ” — Former West Indies captain Sir Viv Richards on Kohli.[143] Kohli scored his fourth Test century (107) at Chennai in the first match of the home Test series against Australia in February 2013. He said he was ""feeling hungry for this series"" after a poor run of form in the two previous series and also disappointed on getting out soon after reaching the hundred-run mark.[144] India completed a 4–0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash Australia in more than four decades.[145] Kohli averaged 56.80 in the series and cemented his spot in the Test team.[146] Setting records Kohli batting against South Africa at Cardiff during the Champions Trophy in June 2013 In June 2013, Kohli featured in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won. He scored a match-winning 144 against Sri Lanka in a warm-up match.[147] He scored 34, 22 and 22 not out in India's group matches against South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan respectively, while India qualified for the semifinals with an undefeated record. In the semifinal against Sri Lanka at Cardiff, he struck 58 not out in an eight-wicket win for India.[53] The final between India and England at Birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. India batted first and Kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 balls, sharing a sixth-wicket partnership of 47 runs off 33 balls with Ravindra Jadeja and helping India reach 129/7 in 20 overs. India went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory.[148] Kohli stood-in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with Kohli being named captain for the remaining matches.[149] In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first hundred as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India.[150] Many senior players including Dhoni were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, with Kohli being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time.[151] In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award.[152] He batted on two more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 58 not out. India completed a 5–0 sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI series.[153] Kohli had a successful time with the bat in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at Pune, he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with Rohit Sharma that came in 17.2 overs,[154] Kohli's innings of 100 not out helped India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of one wicket with more than six overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket, while Kohli's knock became the fastest hundred against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase.[155] He followed that innings with 68 in the next match at Mohali in another Indian defeat,[53] before the next two matches were washed out by rain. In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won the man of the match.[156] He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket.[157] India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings for the first time in his career.[4] Kohli batted twice in the two-match Test series against the West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being dismissed by Shane Shillingford in both innings. This was also the last Test series for Tendulkar and Kohli was expected to take Tendulkar's number 4 batting position after the series.[158] In the first game of the three-match ODI series that followed at Kochi, Kohli made 86 to seal a six-wicket win and won the man of the match.[159] During the match, he also equalled Viv Richards' record of becoming the fastest batsman to make 5,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the landmark in his 114th innings.[160] He missed out on his third century at Visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for 99 playing a hook shot off Ravi Rampaul.[161] India lost the match by two wickets, but took the series 2–1 after winning the last match at Kanpur.[162] With 204 runs at 68.00, Kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was awarded the man of the series.[163] Overseas season India toured South Africa in December 2013 for three ODIs and two Tests. Kohli averaged 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck.[164] In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa[165] and batting at 4 for the first time,[93] Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998.[166] Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, ""The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. I think he [Kohli] showed great discipline and responsibility. It reminds me of Sachin Tendulkar when they came here in 1996.""[167] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match.[168] India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.[93] ""Kohli is the next chosen one. He exudes the intensity of Dravid, the audacity of Sehwag, and the extraordinary range of Tendulkar. That doesn't make him better, simply sui generis, his own unique kind."" “ ” — Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe on Kohli.[169] Kohli continued to amass runs on the subsequent New Zealand tour. He averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series[170] in which his efforts of 111-ball 123 at Napier, 65-ball 78 at Hamilton and 78-ball 82 at Wellington[53] all went in vain as India were defeated 4–0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed[171] including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the match.[172] India then travelled to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni was ruled out of the Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named captain for the tournament.[173] Kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a 213-run third-wicket stand with Ajinkya Rahane, which helped India successfully chase 280.[174] It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh.[175] India were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, in which Kohli scored 48 and 5 respectively.[53] Dhoni returned from injury to captain the team for 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and Kohli was named vice-captain. In India's opening match of the tournament against Pakistan, Kohli top-scored with 36 not out to guide India to a seven-wicket win. He scored 54 off 41 balls in the next game against West Indies and an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls against Bangladesh, both in successful run-chases.[75] In the semifinal, he made an unbeaten 72 in 44 deliveries to help India achieve the target of 173 with six wickets and five balls to spare.[176] He won the man of the match for this knock which he called ""my best T20 innings"".[177] India posted 130/4 in the final against Sri Lanka, in which Kohli scored 77 from 58 balls, and eventually lost the match by six wickets.[178] Kohli had made a total of 319 runs in the tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single World Twenty20 tournament,[179] for which he won the Man of the Tournament award.[178] Kohli and other senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh ahead of the England tour. India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading it 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series averaging just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39.[180] He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging the ball to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times,[181] while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers.[182][183] Geoffrey Boycott said, ""Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He is playing with his bat too far away from his pad. He has to look at video replays of his technique and get back to basics"".[184] India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings.[185] In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour.[75] India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings.[186] Kohli had a successful time during India's home ODI series win over the West Indies in October 2014. His 62 in the second ODI at Delhi was his first fifty across Tests and ODIs in 16 innings since February,[187] and he stated that he got his ""confidence back"" with the innings.[188] He struck his 20th ODI hundred–127 runs in 114 balls–in the fourth match at Dharamsala. India registered a 59-run victory and Kohli was awarded man of the match.[189] Dhoni was rested for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in November, enabling Kohli to lead the team for another full series. Kohli batted at 4 throughout the series and made scores of 22, 49, 53 and 66 in the first four ODIs, with India leading the series 4–0. In the fifth ODI at Ranchi, Kohli came in to bat with India at 14/2 in pursuit of 287. He made an unbeaten 139 off 126 balls to give his team a three-wicket win and a whitewash of Sri Lanka.[190] Kohli was awarded player of the series, and it was the second whitewash under his captaincy.[191] During the series he became the fastest batsman in the world to go past the 6000-run mark in ODIs.[192] With 1054 ODI runs at 58.55 in 2014, he became the second player in the world after Sourav Ganguly to make more than 1,000 runs in ODIs for four consecutive calendar years.[6] Test captaincy For the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time.[193] Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut.[194] In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli came in to bat when the Indian innings was reduced to 57/2 and started batting aggressively. He put on 185 runs for the third wicket with M Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score.[195] Kohli noted that his team was looking for a win and not a draw, while also saying that it was ""the best Test I have been part of"".[196] Kohli's second innings ton was hailed by several Australian commentators as the finest fourth-innings performance they had ever seen in Australia.[197] Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India.[93] In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings. He made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years.[198] Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match.[93] Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.[199] Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain.[200] He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung in for another draw.[201] Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.[200] In January 2015, India failed to win a single match in the tri-nation ODI series against the hosts Australia and England. Kohli was unable to replicate his Test success in ODIs, failing to make a two-digit score in any of the four games.[53] Kohli's ODI form did not improve in the lead-up to the World Cup, with scores of 18 and 5 in the warm-up matches against Australia and Afghanistan respectively. Kohli batting against UAE at Perth during a group stage match of the 2015 World Cup In the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide, Kohli hit 107 in 126 balls, sharing 100-plus partnerships with both Dhawan and Raina, to help India set a total of 300 and win the match by 76 runs. For his knock, he was awarded the man of the match award, his 20th in ODIs and first in a World Cup match.[202] He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa after another century partnership with opening batsman Dhawan. India went on to post 307 in 50 overs and register a 130-run victory in the match. India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33, 44* and 38 against UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively.[53] India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record.[203] In India's 109-run victory in the quarterfinal over Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain for 3 edging the ball to the wicket-keeper. India was eliminated in the semifinal by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short-pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson.[53] Kohli had a slump in form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test which ended in a draw and averaged 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1.[204] Kohli ended his streak of low scores by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India came back and won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years.[205] During South Africa's tour of India, Kohli became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000 runs in T20I cricket, reaching the milestone in his 27th innings.[206] In the ODI series, he made 77 at Rajkot and a match-winning 138 in the fourth ODI at Chennai that helped India draw level in the series.[207] India lost the series after a defeat in the final ODI and Kohli finished the series with an average of 49.[208] India came back to beat the top-ranked South African team 3–0 in the four-match Test series under Kohli's captaincy, and climbed to number two position on the ICC Test rankings.[209] He scored a total of 200 runs in the series at 33.33, including 44 and 88 in the fourth match at Delhi.[93] No. 1 Test team and limited-overs captaincy Kohli started 2016 with scores of 91 and 59 in the first two ODIs of the limited-overs tour of Australia. He followed it up with a pair of hundreds–a run-a-ball 117 at Melbourne and 106 from 92 balls at Canberra–in the next two matches. During the course of the series, he became the fastest batsman in the world to cross the 7000-run mark in ODIs, getting to the milestone in his 161st innings, and the fastest to get to 25 centuries. After the ODI series ended in a 1–4 loss, the Indian team came back to whitewash the Australians 3–0 in the T20I series. Kohli made fifties in all three T20Is with scores of 90 not out,[210] 59 not out[211] and 50, winning two man of the matches as well as the man of the series award.[212] He was also instrumental in India winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh the following month in which he scored 49 in a run-chase of 84 against Pakistan,[213] followed by an unbeaten 56 against Sri Lanka and 41 not out in the Final against Bangladesh in two more successful chases.[214] Kohli maintained his match-winning form in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India, scoring 55 not out in another successful run-chase against Pakistan.[215] He struck an unbeaten 82 from 51 balls in India's must-win group match against Australia in ""an innings of sheer class"" with ""clean cricket shots"".[216][217] The knock helped India win by six wickets and register a spot in the semifinal; Kohli went on to rate the innings as his best in the format.[218] In the semifinal, Kohli top-scored once again with an unbeaten 89 from 47 deliveries, but West Indies overhauled India's total of 192 and ended India's campaign. His total of 273 runs in five matches at an average of 136.50 earned him his second consecutive Man of the Tournament award at the World Twenty20.[219] Playing his first Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 in the first Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in first-class cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests.[220] India went on to wrap the series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred–211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand–as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings.[221] In the subsequent ODI series, Kohli set up two wins for India batting second with unbeaten knocks of 85 at Dharamsala and 134-ball 154 at Mohali.[222] He then made 65 in the series-deciding fifth game at Visakhapatnam which India won. Kohli got double centuries in the next two Test series against England and Bangladesh, making him the first batsman ever to score double centuries in four consecutive series. He broke the record of Australian great Donald Bradman and Indian Rahul Dravid, both of whom had managed to get three. Against England, he got his then-highest Test score of 235.[223] He followed it up with ODI centuries against the West Indies and Sri Lanka in consecutive series, equalling Ricky Ponting's tally of 30 ODI centuries.[224][225][226] In October 2017, he was adjourned the ODI player of the series against New Zealand for scoring two ODI centuries, during the course of which he made a new record for the most runs (8,888), best average (55.55) and highest number of centuries (31) for any batsman when completing 200 ODIs.[227][228] Kohli made several more records during the 3 match Test series against Sri Lanka at home in November. After scoring a century and a double century in the first two Tests, he ended up scoring yet another double century in the third Test, during which he became the eleventh Indian batsman to surpass 5000 runs in Test cricket while scoring his 20th Test century and 6th double century.[229] During this match he also became the first batsman to score six double hundreds as a captain.[230] With 610 runs in the series, Kohli also became the highest run-scorer by an Indian in a three-match Test series and the fourth-highest overall.[231] India comfortably won the three-match series 1–0 and Kohli was adjudged man of the match for the second and third Test matches and player of the series. With this win, India equalled Australia for the record streak of nine consecutive series wins in Test cricket.[232] He ended the year with 2818 international runs, which is recorded as the third-highest tally ever in a calendar year and the highest tally ever by an Indian player.[231] Kohli fared average in the test matches as India lost 0-2 during the South Africa tour in January–February of 2018, but came back strongly to score 558 runs in the 6 ODIs, making a record for the highest runs scored in a bilateral ODI series.[233] This included three centuries, remaining unbeaten in two with a best of 160*.[234] India won the ODI series 5-1, Kohli becoming the first Indian captain to win an ODI series South Africa.[235] In March 2018, Kohli decided to play county cricket in England in June, in order to improve his batting before the start of India's tour to England the following month.[236][237] Indian Premier League In March 2008, Kohli was bought on a youth contract by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000. He had an indifferent 2008 season, with a total of 165 runs in 12 innings at an average of 15.00 and a strike rate of 105.09.[238] He fared slightly better in the second season in which he made a total of 246 runs at 22.36, striking at over 112, while his team made it as far as the final.[239] In the 2010 season, Kohli was the third highest run-getter for his team with 307 runs, averaging 27.90 and improving his strike rate to 144.81.[240] Ahead of the 2011 season, Kohli was the only player retained by the Royal Challengers franchise. Kohli was made vice-captain of the team that year and also captained the team in a few matches when the regular skipper Daniel Vettori was injured. The Royal Challengers coach Ray Jennings opined that the 22-year-old would become the future captain of not only the franchise but also the Indian team.[241] Kohli was the second-highest run-getter of the season, only behind teammate Chris Gayle, and his team finished as runners-up of the IPL. Kohli accumulated a total of 557 runs at an average of 46.41 and a strike rate of over 121 including four fifties.[242] In the 2012 IPL, he was moderately successful, averaging 28 for his 364 runs.[243] After Vettori's retirement, Kohli was appointed as the team's captain for the 2013 season. The Royal Challengers finished fifth on the league table that year, but Kohli found success with the bat. Averaging 45.28, he hit a total of 634 runs at a strike rate of over 138 including six fifties and a top-score of 99 and finished as the season's third-highest run-scorer.[244] Bangalore finished seventh in the next season in which Kohli made 359 runs at 27.61.[245] He found success with the bat in the 2015 IPL in which he led his team to the playoffs. He finished fifth on the season's leading run-getters list with 505 runs at an average of 45.90 and a strike rate of more than 130.[246] At the 2016 IPL, the Royal Challengers finished runners-up and Kohli broke the record for most runs in an IPL season (of 733 runs) by scoring 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08, winning the Orange Cap. He scored four centuries in the tournament, having never scored one in the Twenty20 format before the start of the season, and also became the first player to reach the 4000-run milestone in the IPL. At the launch event of his biography, 'Driven: The Virat Kohli Story' in New Delhi, in October 2016, Kohli announced that RCB would be the IPL franchise that he would permanently play for.[247] Kohli missed the start of the 2017 season due to a shoulder injury. Morever, RCB finished the tournament at the bottom of the table, with Kohli scoring the most runs for his team, with 308 from 10 matches. In the 2018 season, Kohli was retained by RCB for a price tag of 17 crore, the highest for anybody that year. Playing style Kohli is a naturally aggressive batsman[37] with strong technical skills.[248] He usually bats in the middle-order, but, on many occasions, has opened the innings as well. He bats with a slightly open-chested stance[249][250] and a strong bottom-hand grip,[251][252] and is said to have quick footwork.[253] He is known for his wide range of shots, ability to pace an innings and batting under pressure.[254][255][256] He is strong through the mid-wicket and cover region.[257] He has said that the cover drive is his favourite shot, while also saying that the flick shot comes naturally to him.[19] He does not play the sweep shot often, being called ""not a natural sweeper of the cricket ball"".[258] His teammates have praised his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethics.[259][260][261] Kohli is also known to be a ""sharp"" fielder.[262][263] Kohli is regarded as the best limited-overs batsmen in the world, especially while chasing.[264][265] In ODIs, he averages more than 67 in matches batting second as opposed to around 47 batting first.[266] 21 of his 35 ODI hundreds have come in run-chases and he holds the record for most hundreds batting second.[267] Regarding his impressive record batting second, Kohli has said ""I love the whole situation that comes with chasing. I like the challenge of testing myself, figuring out how to rotate strike, when to hit a boundary.""[19] Kohli is often compared to Sachin Tendulkar, due to their similar styles of batting, and sometimes referred to as Tendulkar's ""successor"".[158][167] Many former cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records.[268][269] Kohli has stated that growing up his idol and role model was Tendulkar and that as a kid he ""tried to copy the shots [Tendulkar] played and hit sixes the way he used to hit them.""[270] Former West Indies great Vivian Richards, who is regarded as the most destructive batsman in cricket, stated that Kohli reminds him of himself.[143] In early 2015, Richards said Kohli was ""already legendary"" in the ODI format,[271] while former Australian cricketer Dean Jones called Kohli the ""new king of world cricket"".[272] Kohli is noted for his on-field aggression and was described in the media as ""brash"" and ""arrogant"" during his early career.[261][273] He has got into confrontations with players and umpires on several occasions.[261][274] While many former cricketers have backed his aggressive attitude,[275][276][277] some have criticised it.[261][278] In 2012, Kohli had stated that he tries to limit his aggressive behaviour but ""the build-up and the pressure or the special occasions make it tough to control the aggression.""[279] International centuries As of April 2018[update], Kohli has scored 21 Test centuries and 35 ODI centuries.

He used to wear black wristbands as a cricket superstition; earlier, he used to wear the same pair of gloves with which he had ""been scoring"". Apart from a religious black thread, he has also been wearing a kara on his right arm since 2012.[335] Commercial investments According to Kohli, football is his second favourite sport.[336] In 2014, Kohli became a co-owner of Indian Super League club FC Goa. He stated that he invested in the club with the ""keenness of football"" and because he ""wanted football to grow in India"".[337] He added, ""It's a business venture for me for the future. Cricket's not going to last forever and I'm keeping all my options open after retirement.""[336] In September 2015, Kohli became a co-owner of the International Premier Tennis League franchise UAE Royals,[338] and, in December that year, became a co-owner of the JSW-owned Bengaluru Yodhas franchise in Pro Wrestling League.[339] In November 2014, Kohli and Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) launched a youth fashion brand WROGN. The brand started to produce men's casual wear clothing in 2015 and has tied up with Myntra and Shopper's Stop.[340] In late 2014, Kohli was announced as a shareholder and brand ambassador of the social networking venture 'Sport Convo' based in London. In 2015, Kohli invested 90 crore (US$14 million) to start a chain of gyms and fitness centres across the country. Launched under the name Chisel, the chain of gyms is jointly owned by Kohli, Chisel India and CSE (Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment), the agency which manages Kohli's commercial interests.[341] In 2016, Kohli started Stepathlon Kids, a children fitness venture, in partnership with Stepathlon Lifestyle.[342] Endorsements Kohli was signed up by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh recalls, ""I didn’t go after them after they became stars. In fact, I watched Virat at the 2008 ICC Under-19 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur. I was mighty impressed with his attitude and the way he was marshalling his team. He had that spark. And I told Yuvi to set up the meeting.""[343] Sajdeh manages Kohli's endorsement deals, along with those of other Indian cricketers Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Murali Vijay. It was reported in 2013 that Kohli's brand endorsements were worth over 100 crore.[344] His bat deal with MRF is said to be the costliest deal in Indian cricket history.[343] In 2017, he signed an eight-year endorsement deal with Puma worth about 110 crore, becoming the first Indian sportsperson to sign a 100 crore deal with a brand.[345] In 2014, American Appraisal estimated Kohli's brand value at US$56.4 million placing him fourth on the list of India's most valued celebrity brands.[346] The same year, UK-based magazine SportsPro rated Kohli as the second most marketable athlete in the world behind only Lewis Hamilton, placing him above the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Usain Bolt.[347] In an October 2016 report by Duff & Phelps on India's most valued celebrity brands, Kohli's brand value was estimated to be US$92 million, second only to that of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.[15] In 2017, Kohli was ranked 7th in the list released by Forbes as the Most Valuable Brand among athletes ahead of players like Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy and Stephen Curry with an estimated brand value of $14.5 million.[348] As of September 2017, Kohli has endorsement deals with 17 brands.[349] The brands Kohli previously endorsed include 3C Company, Celkon Mobiles, Cinthol (from Godrej), Clear (from Unilever), Fair & Lovely, Fastrack (from Titan), Pepsi, Flying Machine, Mattel, Munch (from Nestle), Oakley, Red Chief Shoes, Royal Challenge (from United Breweries), Sangam Suitings and Toyota Motors.[350][351][352] Charity Kohli at a VKF charity event in June 2016 In March 2013, Kohli started a charity foundation called Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF). The organisation aims at helping underprivileged kids and conducts events to raise funds for the charity.[353] According to Kohli, the foundation works with select NGOs to ""create awareness, seek support and raise funds for the various causes they endorse and the philanthropic work they engage in.""[354] In May 2014, eBay and Save the Children India conducted a charity auction with VKF, with its proceeds benefiting the education and healthcare of underprivileged children.[355] Kohli has captained the All Heart Football Club, owned by VKF, in charity football matches against All Stars Football Club, owned by Abhishek Bachchan's Playing for Humanity. The matches, known as ""Celebrity Clasico"", feature cricketers playing for All Heart and Bollywood actors in the All Stars team, and are organized to generate funds for the two charity foundations.[356] See also References ^ ""Kohli will take Indian cricket places"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell,"Look up dell in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. Dell (stylized as DELL) is an American multinational computer technology company based in Round Rock, Texas, United States, that develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers and related products and services. Eponymously named after its founder, Michael Dell, the company is one of the largest technological corporations in the world, employing more than 103,300 people worldwide.[3] Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, MP3 players, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its ""build-to-order"" or ""configure to order"" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[4][5] Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services. The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions for enterprise customers.[6][7] Dell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list, until 2014.[8] After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. In 2015, it was the third largest PC vendor in the world after Lenovo and HP.[9] Dell is currently the #1 shipper of PC monitors in the world.[10] Dell is the sixth largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortune magazine.[11] It is the second largest non-oil company in Texas – behind AT&T – and the largest company in the Greater Austin area.[12] It was a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500, until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on October 30, 2013. History[edit] Dell's first logo from 1984 to 1989 2010 version of Dell's Former logo,from 1989 to 2016 Dell's Former logo,from 2010 to 2016 Dell traces its origins to 1984, when Michael Dell created Dell Computer Corporation, which at the time did business as PC's Limited,[13][14] while a student of the University of Texas at Austin. The dorm-room headquartered company sold IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components.[15] Dell dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family. In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the Turbo PC, which sold for $795.[16] PC's Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of operation. In 1986,Joselito Reyes Jr brought in Lee Walker, a 51-year-old venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as Joselito Reyes Jr's mentor and implement Joselito Reyes Jr's ideas for growing the company. Walker was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988. Walker retired in 1990 due to health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.[17] The company dropped the PC’s Limited name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share.[18] In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[19] In 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million in annual revenue. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run.[20] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[21] Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company President and CEO. Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s[edit] Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company’s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.[21] From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out.[22] Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco.[23] In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.[4] Dell attained and maintained the number 1 rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001 right before Windows XP was released. In 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website. In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors.[24] Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.[23] In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.[25] In 2003, the company was rebranded as simply ""Dell Inc."" to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[26] In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman,[27] handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[25] Under Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel, the two companies responsible for Dell's dominance in the PC business. During that time, Dell acquired Alienware,[28] which introduced several new items to Dell products, including AMD microprocessors. To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary. Disappointments[edit] In 2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that year.[29] By June 2006, the stock traded around $25 USD which was 40% down from July 2005—the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom era.[30][31] The slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs,[32] but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation.[33] Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers (a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory). As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins.[22] The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores.[3][30] CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.[32] Despite plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, as desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue, 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses, and Sixty-four percent of its revenue comes from North and South America, according to its 2006 third-quarter results. U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft's Windows Vista (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008.[34][35] Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.[25] Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model. Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent years,[35] yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell's rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift.[36] The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players.[32] Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks, plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.[34] Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator.[25][25][36][37] By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's low spending on R&D relative to its revenue (compared to IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Apple Inc.)—which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices.[29] Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized.[4] Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle.[33] Dell's reputation for poor customer service, since 2002, which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web. The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same lineup sold for hundreds.[38] Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting ""got in the way,"" aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional ""bloatware"" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the ""Dell Hell"" prominent on Internet search engines.[30][39] There was also criticism that Dell used faulty components for its PCs, particularly the 11.8 million OptiPlex desktop computers sold to businesses and governments from May 2003 to July 2005, that suffered from bad capacitors made by a company called Nichicon.[40] A battery recall in August 2006, as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company though later, Sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.[22] 2006 marked the first year that Dell's growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole. By the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell lost its title of the largest PC manufacturer to rival Hewlett Packard whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated thanks to a restructuring initiated by their CEO Mark Hurd.[29][41][42] After four out of five quarterly earnings reports were below expectations, Rollins resigned as President and CEO on January 31, 2007 and founder Michael Dell assumed the role of CEO again.[43] Dell 2.0 and downsizing[edit] Dell announced a change campaign called ""Dell 2.0,"" reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company's products.[36][44] While chairman of the board after relinquishing his CEO position, Michael Dell still had significant input in the company during Rollins' years as CEO. With the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company.[34] Michael Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the ""Dell 2.0"" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance. These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of ""bureaucracy"". Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by Donald Carty, as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting practices.[45] On April 23, 2008, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in Kanata, Ontario, terminating approximately 1100 employees, with 500 of those redundancies effective on the spot, and with the official closure of the center scheduled for the summer. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the city of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building. These plans were reversed, due to a high Canadian dollar that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs.[46] The company had also announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, losing 900 jobs. In total, Dell announced the ending of about 8,800 jobs in 2007–2008 — 10% of its workforce.[47] By the late 2000s, Dell's ""configure to order"" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.[5][48] Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in Austin, Texas (original location)[49][50] and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010. Dell's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to Herbalife.[51][52][53] Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.[48] On January 8, 2009, Dell announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland, with the loss of 1,900 jobs and the transfer of production to its plant in od in Poland.[54] The release of Apple's iPad tablet computer had a negative impact on Dell and other major PC vendors, as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop PCs. Dell's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android.[55][56] The Dell Streak was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen. InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers.[57][58] Dell has responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets.[59] The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to an operating loss in Q3 2012. In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.[60] In the shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world. Dell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, for instance Lenovo's ThinkPad series was winning corporate customers away from Dell's laptops, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping.[61][62] Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45 percent, seven percent at Hewlett Packard, six percent at Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer.[63] Dell has been attempting to offset its declining PC business, which still accounted for half of its revenue and generates steady cash flow,[64] by expanding into the enterprise market with servers, networking, software, and services.[65] It avoided many of the acquisition writedowns and management turnover that plagued its chief rival Hewlett Packard.[56][66] Dell also managed some success in taking advantage of its high-touch direct sales heritage to establish close relationships and design solutions for clients. Despite spending $13 billion on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio beyond hardware,[7] the company was unable to convince the market that it could thrive or made the transformation in the post-PC world,[66] as it suffered continued declines in revenue and share price.[67][68][69][70] Dell's market share in the corporate segment was previously a ""moat"" against rivals but this has no longer been the case as sales and profits have fallen precipitously.[71] 2013 buyout[edit] After several weeks of rumors, which started around January 11, 2013, Dell announced on February 5, 2013 that it had struck a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal, that would have delisted its shares from the NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange and taken it private.[72][73][74] Reuters reported that Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners, aided by a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, would acquire the public shares at $13.65 apiece.[75] The $24.4 billion buyout was projected to be the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis.[76] It is also the largest technology buyout ever, surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $17.5 billion.[76] The founder of Dell, Michael Dell, said of the February offer ""I believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for Dell, our customers and team members"".[77] Dell rival Lenovo reacted to the buyout, saying ""the financial actions of some of our traditional competitors will not substantially change our outlook"".[77] In March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn expressed interest in purchasing Dell.[78] In April 2013, Blackstone withdrew their offer, citing deteriorating business.[79][80] Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, so the ""wide-open bidding war"" never materialized.[7] Analysts said that the biggest challenge facing Silver Lake would be to find an “exit strategy” to profit from its investment, which would be when the company would hold an IPO to go public again, and one warned “But even if you can get a $25bn enterprise value for Dell, it will take years to get out.”[81] In May 2013, Dell joined his board in voting for his offer.[82] The following August he reached a deal with the special committee on the board for $13.88 (a raised price of $13.75 plus a special dividend of 13 cents per share), as well as a change to the voting rules.[83] The $13.88 cash offer (plus a $.08 per share dividend for the third fiscal quarter) was accepted on September 12[84] and closed on October 30, 2013, ending Dell's 25-year run as a publicly traded company. After the buyout the newly private Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Programme that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that Dell may be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.[85] On November 19, 2015, Dell, alongside ARM Holdings, Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft, and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.[86] Acquisitions[edit] Company Acquired Date of Acquisition Company Notes References Alienware 2006 Manufacturer of high-end PCs popular with gamers [87][88][89] EqualLogic January 28, 2008 Acquired to gain a foothold in the iSCSI storage market. Because Dell already had an efficient manufacturing process, integrating EqualLogic's products into the company drove manufacturing prices down [90][91][92] Perot Systems 2009 Perot Systems was a technology services and outsourcing company, mainly active in the health-sector, founded by former presidential hopeful H. Ross Perot. The acquired business provided Dell with applications development, systems integration, and strategic consulting services through its operations in the U.S. and 10 other countries. In addition, the acquisition of Perot brought a variety of business process outsourcing services, including claims processing and call center operations.

AppAssure delivered 194 percent revenue growth in 2011 and over 3500% growth in the prior three years. AppAssure supported physical servers and VMware, Hyper-V and XenServer. The deal represents the first acquisition since Dell formed its software division under former CA CEO John Swainson. Dell added that it will keep AppAssure’s 230 employees and invest in the company.

[110][111] StatSoft March 24, 2014 A global provider of analytics software, in order to bolster its Big Data solutions offering. [112] Acquisition of EMC[edit] Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016 On October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the ""highest-valued tech acquisition in history"".[113][114] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016 The announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business.[116] It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then.[117] EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual ""Federation"" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued[118] this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core ""EMC II"" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9bn from servers, while EMC had $16.5bn from EMC II, $1bn from RSA Security, $6bn from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software.[119] EMC owns around 80 percent of the stock of VMware.[120] The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell.[121] Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.[122] The combined business is expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture, converged infrastructure and private cloud computing, playing to the strengths of both EMC and Dell.[119][123] Commentators have questioned the deal, with FBR Capital Markets saying that though it makes a ""ton of sense"" for Dell, it's a ""nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies"" for EMC.[124] Fortune said there was a lot for Dell to like in EMC's portfolio, but ""does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package? Probably not.""[125] The Register reported the view of William Blair & Company that the merger would ""blow up the current IT chess board"", forcing other IT infrastructure vendors to restructure to achieve scale and vertical integration.[126] The value of VMware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63–64bn rather than the $67bn originally reported.[127] Key investors backing the deal besides Dell are Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.[128] Dell's offer will remain open for 60 days during which EMC can seek other possible buyers, but this is believed to be unlikely: Hewlett-Packard (potentially a better fit for EMC) is preoccupied with its own split,[129] and the deal has been welcomed by Elliott Management and EMC's chairman Joe Tucci.[121] On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed its $60 billion deal to acquire EMC Corp., the largest technology merger in history. The new company, Dell Technologies, employs about 140,000 people globally and will maintain operations in Hopkinton, Mass., where EMC was located. With $74 billion in revenue, Dell Technologies is the world’s largest privately controlled tech company.[130] Dell facilities[edit] Dell's headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas.[131] As of 2013 the company employed about 14,000 people in central Texas and was the region's largest private employer,[132] which has 2,100,000 square feet (200,000 m2) of space.[133] As of 1999 almost half of the general fund of the city of Round Rock originated from sales taxes generated from the Dell headquarters.[134] Dell previously had its headquarters in the Arboretum complex in northern Austin, Texas.[135][136] In 1989 Dell occupied 127,000 square feet (11,800 m2) in the Arboretum complex.[137] In 1990, Dell had 1,200 employees in its headquarters.[135] In 1993, Dell submitted a document to Round Rock officials, titled ""Dell Computer Corporate Headquarters, Round Rock, Texas, May 1993 Schematic Design."" Despite the filing, during that year the company said that it was not going to move its headquarters.[138] In 1994, Dell announced that it was moving most of its employees out of the Arboretum, but that it was going to continue to occupy the top floor of the Arboretum and that the company's official headquarters address would continue to be the Arboretum. The top floor continued to hold Dell's board room, demonstration center, and visitor meeting room. Less than one month prior to August 29, 1994, Dell moved 1,100 customer support and telephone sales employees to Round Rock.[139] Dell's lease in the Arboretum had been scheduled to expire in 1994.[140] By 1996, Dell was moving its headquarters to Round Rock.[141] As of January 1996 3,500 people still worked at the current Dell headquarters. One building of the Round Rock headquarters, Round Rock 3, had space for 6,400 employees and was scheduled to be completed in November 1996.[142] In 1998 Dell announced that it was going to add two buildings to its Round Rock complex, adding 1,600,000 square feet (150,000 m2) of office space to the complex.[143] In 2000, Dell announced that it would lease 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) of space in the Las Cimas office complex in unincorporated Travis County, Texas, between Austin and West Lake Hills, to house the company's executive offices and corporate headquarters. 100 senior executives were scheduled to work in the building by the end of 2000.[144] In January 2001, the company leased the space in Las Cimas 2, located along Loop 360. Las Cimas 2 housed Dell's executives, the investment operations, and some corporate functions. Dell also had an option for 138,000 square feet (12,800 m2) of space in Las Cimas 3.[145] After a slowdown in business required reducing employees and production capacity, Dell decided to sublease its offices in two buildings in the Las Cimas office complex.[146] In 2002 Dell announced that it planned to sublease its space to another tenant; the company planned to move its headquarters back to Round Rock once a tenant was secured.[145] By 2003, Dell moved its headquarters back to Round Rock. It leased all of Las Cimas I and II, with a total of 312,000 square feet (29,000 m2), for about a seven-year period after 2003. By that year roughly 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of that space was absorbed by new subtenants.[147] In 2008, Dell switched the power sources of the Round Rock headquarters to more environmentally friendly ones, with 60% of the total power coming from TXU Energy wind farms and 40% coming from the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management, Inc.[133] Dell facilities in the United States are located in Austin, Texas; Plano, Texas; Nashua, New Hampshire; Nashville, Tennessee; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Peoria, Illinois; Hillsboro, Oregon (Portland area); Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Eden Prairie, Minnesota (Dell Compellent); Bowling Green, Kentucky; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Miami, Florida. Facilities located abroad include Penang, Malaysia; Xiamen, China; Bracknell, UK; Manila, Philippines[148] Chennai, India;[149] Hyderabad, India; Noida, India; Hortolandia and Porto Alegre, Brazil; Bratislava, Slovakia; ód, Poland;[150] Panama City, Panama; Dublin and Limerick, Ireland; Casablanca, Morocco and Montpellier, France. The US and India are the only countries that have all Dell's business functions and provide support globally: research and development, manufacturing, finance, analysis, and customer care.[151] Manufacturing[edit] From its early beginnings, Dell operated as a pioneer in the ""configure to order"" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.[152] To minimize the delay between purchase and delivery, Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers. This also allows for implementing a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing approach, which minimizes inventory costs. Low inventory is another signature of the Dell business model—a critical consideration in an industry where components depreciate very rapidly.[153] Dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including ""burn-in""), and quality control. Throughout most of the company's history, Dell manufactured desktop machines in-house and contracted out manufacturing of base notebooks for configuration in-house.[154] The company's approach has changed, as cited in the 2006 Annual Report, which states, ""We are continuing to expand our use of original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships."" The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2008 that ""Dell has approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell"" their plants.[155] By the late 2000s, Dell's ""configure to order"" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost commodities.[48] Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in Austin, Texas (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999), which have been closed in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina received $280 million USD in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010, and Dell's contract with the state requires them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions.[52][53] Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.[48] Dell assembled computers for the EMEA market at the Limerick facility in the Republic of Ireland, and once employed about 4,500 people in that country. Dell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to Dell's new plant in the Polish city of ód by January 2010.[156] European Union officials said they would investigate a €52.7million aid package the Polish government used to attract Dell away from Ireland.[157] European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened in 1990) and EMF3 form part of the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick. EMF2 (previously a Wang facility, later occupied by Flextronics, situated in Castletroy) closed in 2002,[citation needed] and Dell Inc. has consolidated production into EMF3 (EMF1 now[when?] contains only offices).[158] Subsidies from the Polish government did keep Dell for a long time.[159] After ending assembly in the Limerick plant the Cherrywood Technology Campus in Dublin was the largest Dell office in the republic with over 1200 people in sales (mainly UK & Ireland), support (enterprise support for EMEA) and research and development for cloud computing, but no more manufacturing except[160] Dell's Alienware subsidiary, which manufactures PCs in an Athlone, Ireland plant. Whether this facility will remain in Ireland is not certain.[161] Construction of EMF4 in ód, Poland has started[update]: Dell started production there in autumn 2007.[162] Dell opened plants in Penang, Malaysia in 1995, and in Xiamen, China in 1999. These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. Dell Inc. has invested[when?] an estimated $60 million in a new manufacturing unit in Chennai, India, to support the sales of its products in the Indian subcontinent. Indian-made products bear the ""Made in India"" mark. In 2007 the Chennai facility had the target of producing 400,000 desktop PCs, and plans envisaged it starting to produce notebook PCs and other products in the second half of 2007.[citation needed] Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the Eldorado do Sul plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in Hortolandia, Brazil in 2007.[163] Products[edit] Scope and brands[edit] The corporation markets specific brand names to different market segments. Its Business/Corporate class represent brands where the company advertising emphasizes long life-cycles, reliability, and serviceability. Such brands include: Dell's Home Office/Consumer class emphasizes value, performance, and expandability. These brands include: Inspiron (budget desktop and notebook computers) XPS (high-end desktop and notebook computers) Alienware (high-performance gaming systems) Venue (Tablets Android / Windows) Dell's Peripherals class includes USB keydrives, LCD televisions, and printers; Dell monitors includes LCD TVs, plasma TVs and projectors for HDTV and monitors. Dell UltraSharp is further a high-end brand of monitors. Dell service and support brands include the Dell Solution Station (extended domestic support services, previously ""Dell on Call""), Dell Support Center (extended support services abroad), Dell Business Support (a commercial service-contract that provides an industry-certified technician with a lower call-volume than in normal queues), Dell Everdream Desktop Management (""Software as a Service"" remote-desktop management, originally a SaaS company founded by Elon Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, which Dell bought in 2007[165]), and Your Tech Team (a support-queue available to home users who purchased their systems either through Dell's website or through Dell phone-centers). Discontinued products and brands include Axim (PDA; discontinued April 9, 2007),[166] Dimension (home and small office desktop computers; discontinued July 2007), Dell Digital Jukebox (MP3 player; discontinued August 2006), Dell PowerApp (application-based servers), and Dell Optiplex (desktop and tower computers previously supported to run server and desktop operating systems). Security[edit] Self-signed root certificate[edit] In November 2015 it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an identical pre-installed root certificate known as ""eDellRoot"".[167] This raised such security risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[167] Dell apologised and offered a removal tool.[168] Dell Foundation Services[edit] Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number assigned to them by the program.[169] This was possible even if a customer enabled private browsing and deleted their browser cookies.[169] Ars Technica recommended that Dell customers uninstall the program until the issue was addressed.[169] Commercial aspects[edit] Organization[edit] The board consists of nine directors. Michael Dell, the founder of the company, serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Other board members include Don Carty, Judy Lewent, Klaus Luft, Alex Mandl, and Sam Nunn. Shareholders elect the nine board members at meetings, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a resignation to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees having oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating antitrust laws.[citation needed] Day-to-day operations of the company are run by the Global Executive Management Committee, which sets strategic direction. Dell has regional senior vice-presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for EMEA and Stephen J. Felice for Asia/Japan. As of 2007[update], other officers included Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and Susan Sheskey (vice president and Chief Information Officer).[citation needed] Marketing[edit] Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, catalogs and newspapers. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell cut its prices in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. This also cut profit-margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the Internet and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to India and El Salvador.[170] A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor Ben Curtis playing the part of ""Steven"", a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: ""Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!""[171] A subsequent advertising campaign featured interns at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign). In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from BBDO to Working Mother Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the Flaming Lips and Devo who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad ""Work it Out"". Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan ""Yours is here"" to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.[172] Beginning in 2011, Dell began hosting a conference in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center titled ""Dell World"". The event featured new technology and services provided by Dell and Dell's partners. In 2011, the event was held October 12–14.[173] In 2012, the event was held December 11–13.[174] In 2013, the event was held December 11–13.[175] Dell partner program[edit] In late 2007, Dell Inc. announced that it planned to expand its program to value-added resellers (VARs), giving it the official name of ""Dell Partner Direct"" and a new Website.[176] Dell India has started Online Ecommerce website[177] with its Dell Partner www.compuindia.com GNG Electronics Pvt Ltd[178] termed as Dell Express Ship Affiliate(DESA). The main objective was to reduce the delivery time. Customers who visit Dell India official site are given option to buy online which then will be redirected to Dell affiliate website compuindia.com.[151] Global Analytics[edit] Dell also operate a captive analytics division which supports pricing, web analytics and supply chain operations. DGA operates as a single, centralized entity with a global view of Dell’s business activities. The firm supports over 500 internal customers worldwide and has created a quantified impact of over $500 million.[citation needed] Criticisms of marketing of laptop security[edit] In 2008, Dell received press coverage over its claim of having the world's most secure laptops, specifically, its Latitude D630 and Latitude D830.[179] At Lenovo's request, the (U.S.) National Advertising Division (NAD) evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support it.[180] Dell first opened their retail stores in India.[151] United States[edit] In the early 1990s, Dell sold its products through Best Buy, Costco and Sam's Club stores in the United States. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit-margins on the business, exclusively distributing through a direct-sales model for the next decade. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in Sears stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with Sam's Club and Wal-Mart. Staples, the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and Best Buy, the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year. Starting in 2002, Dell opened kiosk locations in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded kiosk locations to include shopping malls across Australia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong. On January 30, 2008, Dell announced it would shut down all 140 kiosks in the U.S. due to expansion into retail stores.[181] By June 3, 2010, Dell had also shut down all of its mall kiosks in Australia.[182] NorthPark Service Center[edit] In 2006, Dell Inc. opened one full store, 3,000-square-foot (280 m2) in area, at NorthPark Center in Dallas, Texas. It operates the retail outlet seven days a week to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. As at the kiosks, customers can only see demonstration-computers and place orders through agents. Dell then delivers purchased items just as if the customer had placed the order by phone or over the Internet. In addition to showcasing products, the stores also support on-site warranties and non-warranty service (""Dell Solution Station""). Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from hard drives. On February 14, 2008, Dell closed the Service Center in its Dallas NorthPark store and laid off all the technical staff there.[citation needed] Retail stores[edit] As of the end of February 2008[update], Dell products shipped to one of the largest office-supply retailers in Canada, Staples Business Depot. In April 2008, Future Shop and Best Buy began carrying a subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors. Since some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia. In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in Budapest. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow. In the UK, HMV's flagship Trocadero store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of DSGi have sold Dell products (in particular, through Currys and PC World stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket-chain Tesco has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK. In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, Officeworks (part of Coles Group), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with Harris Technology (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, The Good Guys, known for ""Slashing Prices"". Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including Studio and XPS systems in late 2008. Dell and Dick Smith Electronics (owned by Woolworths Limited) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks — owned by Coles Group — reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of Inspiron and Studio notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. As of 2009[update], Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centres throughout Australia. On March 31, 2010 Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program. In Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via Media Markt and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.[183] Competition[edit] Dell's major competitors include Hewlett-Packard (HP), Acer, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Gateway, Sony, Asus, Lenovo, IBM, MSI, Panasonic with its Toughbook series, Samsung and Apple. Dell and its subsidiary, Alienware, compete in the enthusiast market against AVADirect, Falcon Northwest, VoodooPC (a subsidiary of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer market, compared to HP with roughly 15%. In late 2006[update], Dell lost its lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard. Both Gartner and IDC estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped more units[184] worldwide than Dell did. Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner estimated[185] that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%). IDC reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents an 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors EMC and IBM. Partnership with EMC[edit] The Dell/EMC brand applies solely to products that result from Dell's partnership with EMC Corporation.[citation needed] In some cases, Dell and EMC jointly design such products. Other cases involve EMC products that Dell supports—generally midrange storage systems, such as fibre channel and iSCSI storage area networks. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.[186] On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of their strategic partnership that began in 2001. In addition, Dell plans to expand its product line-up by adding the EMC Celerra NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems, as well as partnering on a new line of de-duplication products as part of its TierDisk family of data-storage devices.[187] On October 17, 2011, Dell officially discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, ending a 10 year long partnership 2 years early.[188] Environmental record[edit] Dell committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its global activities by 40% by 2015, with 2008 fiscal year as the baseline year.[189] It is listed in Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are. In November 2011, Dell ranked 2nd out of 15 listed electronics makers (increasing its score to 5.1 from 4.9, which it gained in the previous ranking from October 2010).[190] Dell was the first company to publicly state a timeline for the elimination of toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which it planned to phase out by the end of 2009. It revised this commitment and now aims to remove these toxics by the end of 2011 but only in its computing products.[191] In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam and Copenhagen calling for Dell’s founder and CEO Michael Dell to ‘drop the toxics’ and claiming that Dell’s aspiration to be ‘the greenest technology company on the planet’[192] was ‘hypocritical’.[193] Dell has launched its first products completely free of PVC and BFRs with the G-Series monitors (G2210 and G2410) in 2009.[194] In its 2012 report on progress relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Dell the eighth highest of 24 consumer electronics companies.[195] Green initiatives[edit] Dell became the first company in the information technology industry to establish a product-recycling goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.[196] On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its ""Recycling Works"" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.[197] On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009. The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.[198] On June 5, 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term.[199] The company launched a zero-carbon initiative that includes: reducing Dell's carbon intensity by 15 percent by 2012 requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews partnering with customers to build the ""greenest PC on the planet"" expanding the company's carbon-offsetting program, ""Plant a Tree for Me"" The company introduced the term ""The Re-Generation"" during a round table in London commemorating 2007 World Environment Day. ""The Re-Generation"" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a difference in improving the world's environment. Dell also talked about plans to take the lead in setting an environmental standard for the technology industry and maintaining that leadership in the future.[citation needed] Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocol. Dell's 2008 CSR report ranked as ""Application Level B"" as ""checked by GRI"".[200] The company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through energy-efficient evolution of products, and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programs. Internal energy-efficiency programs reportedly save the company more than $3 million annually in energy-cost savings. The largest component of the company's internal energy-efficiency savings comes through PC power management: the company expects to save $1.8 million in energy costs through using specialized energy-management software on a network of 50,000 PCs. Criticism[edit] In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).[201][202] In 2005, complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.[203] In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call transfers[204] of more than 45% of calls and long wait times. Dell's blog detailed the response: ""We're spending more than a $100 million — and a lot of blood, sweat and tears of talented people — to fix this.""[205] Later in the year, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150 million.[206] Despite significant investment in this space, Dell continues to face public scrutiny with even the company's own website littered with complaints regarding the issue escalation process.[207][original research?] On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of between $50 million and $150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.[208] The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.[209] It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from Intel for agreeing not to buy processors from rival manufacturer AMD. In 2010 Dell finally paid $100 million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.[210] In July 2009, Dell apologized after drawing the ire of the Taiwanese Consumer Protection Commission for twice refusing to honour a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its Taiwanese website. In the first instance, Dell offered a 19"" LCD panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honour the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) a customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1 million (US$31250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price.[211] The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as the prestigious firm said the company mispriced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.[212] After Michael Dell made a $24.4 billion buyout bid in August 2013, activist shareholder Carl Icahn sued the company and its board in an attempt to derail the bid and promote his own forthcoming offer.[213] See also[edit] References[edit] ^ ""Dell Company Profile"".

Weightlifters through with their campaign, wrestlers yet to take off and boxers only getting into medal rounds, the number of medal were not too many to show on day six of the Games. However, India held on to their third spot in the overall tally, behind hosts Australia and England. The Indian contingent has so far collected 11 gold, four silver and six bronze medals. t the Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre, Chaudhary gave India India their only other medal of the day in para powerlifting with an effort of 181kg in the men's heavyweight final. he medal was redemption of sorts for Chaudhary, who was banned for two years after failing a dope test in 2014. He had tested positive for the anabolic steroid methandienone and testosterone abuse in June that year. ithout dwelling on his past, the lifter merely said he expects the medal to change things for good for him. t was a brilliant day for the boxers at the Oxenford Studios, where all five in action assured themselves of medals by advancing to the semi-finals. Among them was veteran Manoj Kumar (69kg), a gold-medallist from the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. oining him were a bunch of debutants -- Amit Panghal (49kg), Mohammed Hussamuddin (56kg), the 19-year-old Naman Tanwar (91kg) and former Asian Games bronze-medallist Satish Kumar (+91kg). The boxers have so far guaranteed themselves six medals in all as, among the women, M C Mary Kom (48kg) is also through to the semifinals."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,"Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to ""learn"" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.[1] The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.[2] Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,[3] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,[5]:2 through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach,[6] optical character recognition (OCR),[7] learning to rank, and computer vision. Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,[8] where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning.[5]:vii[9] Machine learning can also be unsupervised[10] and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities[11] and then used to find meaningful anomalies. Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to ""produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results"" and uncover ""hidden insights"" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.[12] Effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver.[13][14] Overview[edit] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.""[15] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".[16] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed. Machine learning tasks[edit] Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether there is a learning ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to a learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback: Semi-supervised learning: the computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. Active learning: the computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling. Reinforcement learning: training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent.[5]:3 Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Machine learning applications[edit] Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:[5]:3 In classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are ""spam"" and ""not spam"". In regression, also a supervised problem, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. In clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task. Density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space. Dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics. Among other categories of machine learning problems, learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience. Developmental learning, elaborated for robot learning, generates its own sequences (also called curriculum) of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation. History and relationships to other fields[edit] Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term ""Machine Learning"" in 1959 while at IBM[17]. As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[19]:25 Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[20] It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the Internet. Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.[21] Relation to statistics[edit] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields. According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[22] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[22] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[23] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[24] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[25][26] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error. For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[27] In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches[edit] Decision tree learning[edit] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model, which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value. Association rule learning[edit] Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Artificial neural networks[edit] An artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called ""neural network"" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is vaguely inspired by biological neural networks. Computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables. Deep learning[edit] Falling hardware prices and the development of GPUs for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[28] Inductive logic programming[edit] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Support vector machines[edit] Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. Clustering[edit] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness (similarity between members of the same cluster) and separation between different clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data analysis. Bayesian networks[edit] A Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Reinforcement learning[edit] Reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of long-term reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected. Representation learning[edit] Several learning algorithms, mostly unsupervised learning algorithms, aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. Classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions, allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse (has many zeros). Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors.[29] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[30] Similarity and metric learning[edit] In this problem, the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects. It then needs to learn a similarity function (or a distance metric function) that can predict if new objects are similar. It is sometimes used in Recommendation systems. Sparse dictionary learning[edit] In this method, a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse. Let x be a d-dimensional datum, D be a d by n matrix, where each column of D represents a basis function. r is the coefficient to represent x using D. Mathematically, sparse dictionary learning means solving x  D r {\displaystyle x\approx Dr} where r is sparse. Generally speaking, n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation. Learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard and also difficult to solve approximately.[31] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is K-SVD. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to. Suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built. Then a new datum is associated with the class such that it's best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[32] Genetic algorithms[edit] A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, and uses methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms found some uses in the 1980s and 1990s.[33][34] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[35] Rule-based machine learning[edit] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves `rules’ to store, manipulate or apply, knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[36] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Learning classifier systems[edit] Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component (e.g. typically a genetic algorithm) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning). They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[37] Applications[edit] Applications for machine learning include: In 2006, the online movie company Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[43] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[44] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of Machine Learning to predict the financial crisis. [45] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[46] In 2014, it has been reported that a machine learning algorithm has been applied in Art History to study fine art paintings, and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences between artists.[47] Model assessments[edit] Classification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the N-fold-cross-validation method randomly splits the data in k subsets where the k-1 instances of the data are used to train the model while the kth instance is used to test the predictive ability of the training model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[48] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the False Negative Rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model’s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC’s associated Area Under the Curve (AUC). Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[49] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[50][51] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning. Because language contains biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn bias.[52] Software[edit] Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following : Free and open-source software[edit] Proprietary software with free and open-source editions[edit] Proprietary software[edit] Journals[edit] Conferences[edit] See also[edit] References[edit] ^ Supposedly paraphrased from: Samuel, Arthur (1959).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Rogue_Nation,"Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris, Ving Rhames, Simon McBurney and Tom Hollander, with Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames reprising their roles from previous films. Rogue Nation is produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, and David Ellison of Skydance Productions. In the film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is on the run from the CIA, following the IMF's disbandment as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a mysterious international terrorist consortium. Filming began on August 21, 2014, in Vienna, Austria, and concluded on March 12, 2015. The film was released in North America by Paramount Pictures on July 31, 2015. In its opening weekend it took in $55.5 million at the U.S. box office[4] and went on to gross $195 million in North America and $682 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the series, as well as the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2015. A sequel, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, is scheduled for release on July 27, 2018 with Simon Pegg returning as Benji Dunn and McQuarrie also returning as writer and director. After intercepting nerve gas being sold to Chechen terrorists in Minsk, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is determined to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a criminal consortium the CIA does not believe exists. Hunt is captured by the Syndicate at a record shop in London, while their leader, a blond man in glasses, kills the IMF agent stationed there. Hunt escapes a torture chamber led by Syndicate member Janik ""Bone Doctor"" Vinter with the help of disavowed MI6 agent and Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust. In Washington, D.C., CIA Director Alan Hunley and IMF Field Operations Director William Brandt testify before a Senate committee. The IMF, currently without a secretary in charge, is controversial because of its destructive methods and various misconducts. Hunley succeeds in having the IMF disbanded and absorbed into the CIA. Brandt, knowing Hunley will try to capture Hunt, warns him to stay undercover. Cut off from the IMF, Hunt follows his only lead: the man in glasses, later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane. Six months later, Hunt, still a fugitive living in Paris (luring a CIA team to a decoy safe house in Havana), enlists former colleague Benji Dunn to attend an opera in Vienna, predicting that an assassination attempt will be made on the Austrian Chancellor at the performance, and that Lane will also be there. The two stop three snipers, including Faust, but the Chancellor is killed by a car bomb, and Lane is still not found. Faust drops hints of Lane's plan to Hunt before leaving. Dunn stays with Hunt instead of reporting back to the CIA, despite knowing his action amounts to treason. Hunt, blamed for the Chancellor's death, is pursued by the CIA's Special Activities Division. Brandt contacts Luther Stickell to find Hunt before the CIA does. Stickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to Casablanca, where they acquire a secret file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data, evading both Hunt and Syndicate members, although Hunt kills the pursuing agents. Dunn reveals he copied the data onto a second USB drive, as Stickell and Brandt catch up to them. Faust returns to London and attempts to use the file to quit her mission to infiltrate the Syndicate, but her MI6 handler, Atlee, compels her to continue, whilst discreetly wiping her drive. Meanwhile, Ethan learns that the data is an encrypted British government red box that requires the Prime Minister's biometrics to unlock it. Lane's men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to blackmail Hunt into decrypting the data and delivering it to them. Hunt agrees to the ultimatum, despite protests from Brandt. As part of Hunt's plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. At a London charity auction, Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee take the PM to a secure room to protect him from Hunt. Brandt has the PM confirm the existence of the Syndicate, a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, effectively making the PM ""judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability"", before Atlee reveals himself as Hunt in a mask. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission, and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6. With the PM's biometrics, Stickell discovers the file contains access to 2.4 billion British pounds in various bank accounts, which would allow the Syndicate to continue their operations unnoticed; Hunt promptly destroys the data. At the meeting, outside the Tower of London, he tells Lane he memorized the data, and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Ethan and Faust are chased through the streets of London by Lane's men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Ethan confronts Lane and lures him into a sealed, bulletproof glass cell where he is gassed unconscious and taken into custody. Hunley, having witnessed an IMF operation's success firsthand, returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and convinces them to restore the IMF by covering for Hunt and his team. After the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, an IMF Field Operations Director Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent undercover in the Syndicate Alec Baldwin as Alan Hunley, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Sean Harris as Solomon Lane, a former MI6 agent who went rogue and became the supreme leader of the Syndicate Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent and computer specialist Simon McBurney as Atlee, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service Tom Hollander as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Zhang Jingchu as Lauren, a CIA analyst Jens Hultén as Janik Vinter, a former KGB operative and Lane's second-in-command Hermione Corfield as an IMF agent who doubles as a record-shop keeper in London Production[edit] Pre-production[edit] Paramount Pictures announced in August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would direct the fifth Mission: Impossible film, from a script by Drew Pearce, with Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. Tom Cruise Productions and Bad Robot would produce, and Skydance Productions, who served as co-financers and executive producers of the latest installment, will work closely with the team in the development and production process.""[5] On November 14, 2013, Paramount announced a release date of December 25, 2015.[6] The same month, Simon Pegg confirmed he would reprise his role as Benji.[7] In May 2014, Will Staples replaced Pearce as screenwriter.[8] Also that month, Jeremy Renner confirmed he was returning in the role of William Brandt,[9] and Cruise said the film would shoot in London,[10] with a later report saying it would first shoot in Vienna in August.[11] At some point, McQuarrie replaced Staples as screenwriter; the final credits list McQuarrie as screenwriter, with story by Pearce. In July 2014, Rebecca Ferguson was cast and Alec Baldwin was in talks for the film.[12][13] Baldwin was confirmed to have joined the cast in August 2014,[14] and Ving Rhames was confirmed to be reprising his role of Luther Stickell.[15] On September 5, it was announced that Sean Harris was in negotiations for the villain role.[16] On October 2, Simon McBurney joined the cast of the film.[17] On October 6, Chinese actress Zhang Jingchu joined the film's cast (she only appears for 30 seconds in the finished film).[18][19] On March 22, 2015, Paramount revealed the film's official title, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, along with a teaser poster and trailer.[20] Filming[edit] This particular Airbus A400M Atlas, registered F-WWMZ, was used to film the action scene at RAF Wittering Principal photography began in August 2014. On August 21, the production released its first photos from the set in Vienna, Austria.[14] In August actors Cruise and Pegg, along with director Christopher McQuarrie, were in Vienna, at the Metro[21] and on the roof-top of Vienna State Opera.[21][22][23] After finishing one and a half weeks of filming in Austria, on August 30, Cruise arrived in the Moroccan capital city of Rabat for filming more scenes.[24][25] Here the Marrakesh Highway was closed for 14 days (August 30–September 12). Other filming locations in Morocco include Agadir, Rabat[26] and.[27][28][29] On September 8 and 9, filming took place in The Marrakesh Stadium, which was closed both days for filming purposes,[30] and Kasbah of the Udayas, in Rabat.[31] After more than a month of shooting in Austria and Morocco, filming moved to London on September 28.[32] On October 10, Cruise and his stuntman Wade Eastwood were filming some scenes in Monaco.[33] Filming of an action scene featuring Ethan Hunt climbing and hanging on the outside of a flying Atlas C1 took place at RAF Wittering near Stamford. Tom Cruise performed the sequence, at times suspended on the aircraft over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in the air, without the use of a stunt double.[34] To pull off this particular stunt, the production team were given a limited period of only 48 hours. The plane took off and landed 8 times before they had the perfect shot.[35] On November 9, filming began on Southampton Water, and Fawley Power Station.[36] Tom Cruise trained under diving specialist Kirk Krack to be able to hold his breath for three minutes to perform an underwater sequence which was filmed in a single long take without any edits (though the scene in the movie was cut with several breaks, giving the impression for the scene having several takes).[37] However, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood claims that Cruise held his breath for just over six minutes.[35] On February 20, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter said filming was halted to give McQuarrie, Cruise, and an unknown third person time to rework the film's ending.[38] Filming ended on March 12, 2015.[39] Soundtrack[edit] The musical score for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously collaborated with director McQuarrie on The Way of the Gun and Jack Reacher. Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in September 2014.[40] The soundtrack was recorded with small orchestral sections at British Grove Studios and with full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.[41][42] As well as incorporating Lalo Schifrin's thematic material from the television series throughout the score, three tracks (""Escape to Danger,"" ""A Matter of Going"", and ""Finale and Curtain Call"") interpolate Puccini's Nessun dorma aria.[42][43] The physical soundtrack became available from La-La Land Records on July 28, 2015, with the digital album released from Paramount Music on the same day.

On January 26, 2015, Paramount advanced the release date to July 31, 2015.[44] The main reason cited by The Hollywood Reporter was to avoid competition with two other 2015 films, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Spectre.[45] In the United States and Canada, it was released in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema, the first ever time for Paramount.[46] On February 13, 2015, Paramount and IMAX Corporation announced that they would digitally re-master the film into the IMAX format and release it in IMAX theaters worldwide on the scheduled date.[47] The film was completed at 2:00AM on July 18, 2015, less than two weeks before its release date. The film was officially released in North America on July 31, 2015. Lotte released the film in South Korea on July 30, 2015.[48] The film was released in China on September 8, 2015.[49] In August 2015, Fox Networks acquired the US cable broadcast rights, for broadcast after its theatrical release. The film will be available for FX Networks and its suite of networks: FX, FXX, FXM, and the video-on-demand platform FXNow.[50] Marketing[edit] A teaser trailer for the film was released on March 22, 2015.[51] The following day, a full-length trailer was released.[52] A second full-length trailer was released on June 3, 2015. Paramount Pictures spent $42 million on advertising for the film.[53] A comic book was released in conjunction with the film's DVD/Blu-ray release. It follows Hunt going rogue during the events of the film. The comic is written by the film's writer and director Christopher McQuarrie and illustrations by Lazarus artist Owen Freeman.[54] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation grossed $195 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $487.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $682.7 million.[3] Although Rogue Nation was projected to become the highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the biggest movie for Cruise,[55] it apparently fell short of eclipsing Ghost Protocol's final gross to become the second-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the second biggest film for Cruise.[56] It had a worldwide opening of $121 million and an IMAX worldwide opening total of $12.5 million (the third-biggest of July behind The Dark Knight Rises and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2).[57] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $108.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[58] United States and Canada[edit] In the United States and Canada, according to pre-release tracking, the film was projected to earn around $40–50 million in its opening weekend, less than what the first three Mission: Impossible films earned in their initial weekend.[59][60][61] It made $4 million from its Thursday night showings which began at 8 p.m. from 2,764 theaters,[62][63] and $20.3 million on its opening day, which is the second-biggest opening day for Cruise (behind War of the Worlds) and the biggest in the Mission: Impossible franchise (breaking Mission: Impossible 2's record), with 16% of ticket sales from the film's 367 IMAX theaters.[59][64][65] In its opening weekend the film grossed $55.5 million exceeding expectations and is the second-highest opening in the franchise, behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($57.8 million) and the third-biggest for Cruise behind War of the Worlds ($64.8 million) and Mission: Impossible 2.[66][67] IMAX contributed $8.4 million of the total opening gross from 369 IMAX screens which is the third-best for a July opening after The Dark Knight Rises ($19 million) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 ($15.2 million). Premium large format grossed up $2.6 million, 13% of Friday's gross with Cinemark XD grossing close to $700,000 at 108 screens.[66] It remained at the top spot for the second weekend earning an estimated $28.5 million (down 48.7%) from 3,988 theaters (32+ theaters) buoyed by strong word of mouth, rapturous reviews and strong plays at IMAX theaters.[68] Revenues from IMAX also dropped steadily by 39% to $4.3 million in its second weekend.[69] It topped the North American box office for two consecutive weekends until surpassed by the music biographical drama Straight Outta Compton in its third weekend.[70][71][72] It ended its theatrical run on October 29, 2015, playing in theaters for a total of 91 days, or 13 weeks, earning a total of $195 million at the North American box office which is just 28.6% of its total worldwide gross.[3] It is the third-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($215 million) and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol ($209 million).[56] Other countries[edit] Elsewhere, the film opened in 40 overseas markets including 135 IMAX theaters on July 31, 2015 in big markets such the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia.[59] It grossed $64.5 million in its opening weekend and went No. 1 in 33 markets and IMAX contributed $4.1 million of its international opening.[57] Revenues from its second weekend increased by 0.5% to $65 million. It added 18 new markets including India, Japan, and Russia and opened at No. 1 in 17 of the 18 markets with the exception of Japan where it was behind Jurassic World.[73] Overall, it opened at No. 1 in 55 of the 63 territories it has been released in and had the biggest opening weekend ever for the franchise in 46 markets and Cruise's best opening in 40 markets.[57][73][74] It topped the box office outside of North America for three consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Paramount's own Terminator Genisys in its fourth weekend[74][75] and four in total.[76] It had the biggest opening for the franchise in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($8.3 million), France ($7 million), India ($6.5 million), Japan ($6.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($5.3 million), Mexico ($5 million), the Middle East ($4.7; including $2.5 million from UAE alone), Taiwan ($5.1 million), Australia ($3.8 million), Germany ($3.2 million) and Brazil ($3.1 million).[57][73][75][77] In South Korea, where the franchise has been a hit it opened to $16.95 million (49% above Ghost Protocol), which is the second-biggest opening ever for Paramount, behind Transformers: Dark of the Moon; Cruise's biggest-ever opening; the best for the Mission: Impossible franchise; and the second-biggest opening for a Western film of 2015.[57][78] It added $8.1 and $3.7 million in its second and third weekend for a total of $41.1 million making South Korea the film's second-highest market followed by Japan ($41.2 million), the United Kingdom ($32 million), France ($20.9 million), and Germany ($13 million).[79][80][81][82] In Japan, it faced competition with the continued run of Jurassic World.[83] In China, Rogue Nation emerged very successful and earned $18.5 million on its opening day of September 8 (including $1.4 million from midnight screenings), which is the country's biggest opening for a Hollywood 2D film, the second-biggest for any 2D film in China (only behind the $22.2 million debut of local 2D film Pancake Man), and the fifth-biggest opening for any film.[84][85] Despite opening on a Tuesday—during which most children are off to school—the film opened successfully and almost matched the opening figure of North America. Rob Cain of Forbes cited out possible reasons for the successful opening: the well-establishment of the franchise in China (its immediate predecessor Ghost Protocol earned $102.7 million), rapid expansion and growth of Chinese movie market, being the second Hollywood movie (after Terminator Genisys) to be released after the nearly 60-day blackout period in which non-Chinese movies were dabarred from going to general release in the country, and the successful awareness campaign and marketing efforts by the team including Tom Cruise visiting several Chinese cities.[85] It went on to earn an estimated $85.8 million through its opening weekend (Tuesday–Sunday) from 5,500 screens.[76] It is the highest-grossing 2D Hollywood film there with $136.8 million (breaking Interstellar's record).[81][82][86][87] Rogue Nation was projected to make roughly 70% of its worldwide gross abroad,[64] and indeed ended up making $487,287,762 or 71.4% of its entire worldwide gross overseas[3] which is the highest among the series.[56] Critical response[edit] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation has a rating of 93% based on 293 reviews and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation continues the franchise's thrilling resurgence—and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal.""[88] Metacritic gives the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[89] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of ""A–"" on an A+ to F scale.[90] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film ""preposterously enjoyable"" and said that it ""unfolds with fluid, twisty, old-school pleasure,"" highlighting the performances of Cruise, Pegg, Ferguson, and Baldwin and comparing the action scenes to those of the James Bond films as well as Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). He ultimately gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.[91] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Rogue Nation 3.5 out of 4 stars, highly praising the film's cast and stating that the film ""keeps topping itself"". However, he criticized the villain for not being too memorable or intimidating.[92] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that McQuarrie's direction allowed Rogue Nation to stand out among the other films in terms of action and its inclusion of female characters, singling out Ferguson's Ilsa as uniquely empowered and action-oriented, also praising her scenes with Cruise.[93] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic praised Cruise, saying ""You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer, unvarnished willpower, a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance"" and describing him as the driving force of the film and the franchise. He, too, praised Ferguson among the supporting cast for her role as an action heroine.[94] Joseph Wigler of MTV.com considered the movie as ""one of the most entertaining Ethan Hunt adventures"" which proves that ""the franchise still has plenty of fight left in it, with no signs of slowing down.""[95] He praised the performances of Cruise and Ferguson,[95] applauding the latter for playing ""the most fascinating character in the entire movie"" and ""one of the most complicated and alluring characters in the entire five film series.""[96] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated ""Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, 'Rogue Nation' is pretty much like most of the 'Impossible' movies in that it’s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star.""[97] A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club remarked, ""Rather than go full auteur on his formulaic material, McQuarrie instead offers a kind of greatest-hits package: 'Rogue Nation' marries the shifting loyalties of Brian De Palma's original to the kinetic action beats of John Woo’s series nadir and the all-set-piece structure of Brad Bird's series zenith, adding an omnipotent villain not far removed from the one Philip Seymour Hoffman played in J.J. Abrams' entry. It’s the least visually or conceptually distinctive of the five movies, leaning on what's worked before rather than forging its own path.""[98] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, calling it ""breathlessly thrilling"" and giving high praise to its action sequences, saying "" all you can do is pick your jaw off your lap and grin at the breathtakingly bananas spectacle you've just witnessed.""[99] Meanwhile, David Edelstein of Vulture.com called Ferguson the ""best reason"" to see the film. However, he felt it did not surpass its predecessor and singled out several elements of some of the action sequences for criticism.[100] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal also praised Ferguson but felt that she and Cruise had ""zero chemistry"" onscreen. Nonetheless, he praised the film for working ""ingenious changes on old tropes"".[101] Daniel Krupa of IGN only gave the film a score of 7/10, praising the action sequences and the performances of the central cast but criticizing it for not adding enough to the series or expanding on the plot of Ghost Protocol.[102] Accolades[edit] By May 2015, Paramount was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Cruise, Abrams, Ellison, and Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development.[114] Christopher McQuarrie returned to write and direct the film, which began filming April 2017 for a July 2018 release.[115] References[edit] ^ a b c d e Grierson, Tim (July 23, 2015).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise,"Thomas ""Tom"" Cruise (born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV; July 3, 1962) is an American actor and producer. He has been nominated for three Academy Awards and has won three Golden Globe Awards. He started his career at age 19 in the film Endless Love. Since 1996, Cruise has been well known for his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible film series, whose most recent film, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, was released in 2015. In 2012, Cruise was Hollywood's highest-paid actor.[1] Sixteen of his films grossed over $100 million in the United States, and 23 have grossed in excess of $200 million worldwide.[2] As of September 2017, Cruise's films have grossed more than $3.7 billion at U.S. and Canadian box offices and more than $9.0 billion worldwide,[3] making him the eighth highest-grossing actor in North America and one of the top-grossing actors worldwide.[4] He has won Golden Globe Awards for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture in Drama in 1990 for Born on the Fourth of July; Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture in Comedy/Musical in 1997 for Jerry Maguire; and Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture in 2000 for Magnolia. In 2002, Cruise won the Saturn Award for Best Actor for Vanilla Sky. In 2003, he won an AFI Movie of the Year Award for The Last Samurai and an Empire Award for Best Actor for Minority Report. Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs, and credits it with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, his Church affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, particularly for 9/11 rescue workers, and efforts to promote Scientology as a religion in Europe, sparked controversies, as did a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology. Early life Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III,[5] an electrical engineer, both originally from Louisville, Kentucky.[6][7] He has three sisters: Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. They are of English, German, and Irish ancestry.[8][9] One of Cruise's paternal great-great-great-grandfathers, Patrick Russell Cruise, was born in north County Dublin in 1799; he married Teresa Johnson in County Meath, in 1825. They left Ireland for the United States that same year and settled in New York.[8] They had a daughter, Mary Paulina Russell Cruise, whose son Thomas Cruise Mapother was Cruise's great-grandfather.[10][11][12][13] A cousin, William Mapother, is also an actor; he and Cruise have appeared in five films together.[14] Cruise grew up in near poverty, and had a Catholic upbringing. The family was dominated by his abusive father, whom Cruise has described as ""a merchant of chaos.""[15] Cruise has said that he was beaten by his father, whom he has called a ""bully and coward."" He stated, ""He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'""[15] Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. His family moved to Beacon Hill, Ottawa, in late 1971 so that Cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces.[16] There, Cruise attended the newly opened Robert Hopkins Public School for much of grade four and grade five.[16][17] In grade four, Cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.[16] Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected, ""The movement and improvisation were excellent. It was a classic ensemble piece.""[16] Cruise also enjoyed sports at the school and played floor hockey, though he was known more for his aggression than his talent.[citation needed] In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa, Canada. However, in the spring of that year, Cruise's mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States.[16] His father died of cancer in 1984.[18] Cruise briefly attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, on a church scholarship and aspired to become a Catholic priest, before his interest in acting.[19]:24–26 In his senior year, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but he was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.[19]:47 In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years, including stints in at least two suburban New Jersey towns, including Glen Ridge.[20] Career Acting Cruise first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as ""A Generation X classic, and a career-maker for Tom Cruise"",[21] and which, along with 1986's Top Gun, cemented his status as a superstar.[22] Cruise also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985.[23] Cruise followed up Top Gun with The Color of Money, which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. 1988 saw him star in Cocktail, which earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in 1989's Born on the Fourth of July, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination. Cruise's next films were Days of Thunder (1990) and Far and Away (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel. The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.[24] In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of Mission: Impossible, which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.[25] In 1996, he took on the title role in Jerry Maguire, for which he earned a Golden Globe and his second nomination for an Academy Award. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut, and took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Magnolia, for which he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award. In 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the Mission Impossible films, releasing Mission: Impossible 2. The film was directed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style, and it continued the series' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures, like its predecessor, being the third highest-grossing film of the year; despite being a success it along with its predecessor received a mixed reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award as Best Male Performance for this film. His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.[26][27] The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller Vanilla Sky (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction thriller, Minority Report which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick. In 2003, he starred in the Edward Zwick's historical drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination as best actor. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star, and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.[26] In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, it grossed nearly $400 million at the box office.[28] In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as ""Les Grossman"" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.[29] In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010.[30] On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011[31] to high critical acclaim[32] and box office success.[33] Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it is Cruise's biggest commercial success to date.[34] On May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist.[35] In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie Rock of Ages, in which he played the character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012.[36] Cruise starred as Jack Reacher, an adaptation of British author Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot. The film was released on December 21, 2012.[37] It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $216,568,266 worldwide.[38][39] In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film Oblivion based on director Joseph Kosinski's graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $285,600,588 worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko.[40][41] As of mid-2015 Cruise's films have grossed about $8.2 billion worldwide.[42] Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, which he also produced.[43] Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff's 1932 horror movie The Mummy.[44] The new film, also titled The Mummy, is the second installment in the Universal Studios' Monsters Cinematic Universe, intended to be a shared universe with reboots of all the studios' classic monster characters. The film was produced by Alex Kurtzman, Chris Morgan, and Sean Daniel. It was written by Jon Spaihts and directed by Kurtzman. Producing Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993,[45] and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being Mission: Impossible in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer. Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as ""one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood."" Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.[46] Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson's New York Times bestseller, The Devil in the White City about a real life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World's Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.[47] Cruise has produced for multiple films in which he has been. He produced Mission: Impossible, Without Limits, Mission: Impossible 2, The Others, Vanilla Sky and many others.[48] Breakup with Paramount On August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the Wall Street Journal, chairman of Viacom (Paramount's parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.[49][50] Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.[51] Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the Mission: Impossible franchise.[52][53] Management of United Artists In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists.[45] Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive. Production began in 2007 of Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marks the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007,[54] opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception. In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.[55] Relationships Cruise has been married and divorced three times and has three children (two adopted and one biological). In the early to mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with older women, including Rebecca De Mornay,[56] three years his senior; Patti Scialfa,[57] nine years his senior; and Cher,[58] sixteen years his senior.[59] Marriage to Mimi Rogers Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987.[60] They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers introduced Cruise to Church of Scientology.[61] Marriage to Nicole Kidman Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film Days of Thunder (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. Cruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella and Connor Antony. In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended with a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying in an interview, ""It was wrongly reported,"" and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.[62] Before Kidman's next marriage to Keith Urban, she spoke of how much she still loved Cruise, saying in 2006: ""He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him.""[63] Dating Penelope Cruz and Nazanin Boniadi Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in Vanilla Sky (2001). The relationship ended in 2004.[64] An article in the October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair states that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, the Church of Scientology launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of ""auditions"" of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology.[65] The Church of Scientology and Cruise's lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing Vanity Fair of ""shoddy journalism"" and ""religious bigotry.""[66] Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.[67][68] Marriage to Katie Holmes In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes – dubbed ""TomKat"" by the media – made their first public appearance together in Rome.[69] A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on The Oprah Winfrey Show, famously jumping up and down on Winfrey's couch during the show.[70] On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child.[71] In April 2006 their daughter Suri was born. On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, in a Scientology ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars.[72][73] The actors' publicist said the couple had ""officialized"" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[74] There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology.[75][76] David Miscavige, the head of the Church of Scientology, served as Cruise's best man.[77] On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise after five and a half years of marriage.[78][79] On July 9, 2012, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers.[80] Because New York law requires that all divorce documents remain sealed, the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.[81] Scientology Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers at the 1989 Oscars Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers.[82] Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age[83] and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.[84] Cruise's advocacy of Scientology In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Gaudin, described him as a spokesman and militant for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.[85][86] Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession[87] and from firefighters.[88] For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.[89] Criticism of psychiatry In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement ""I think psychiatry should be outlawed.""[90] Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an anti-depressant to which Shields attributes her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. Shields responded that Cruise ""should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.""[91] This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC's Today on June 24, 2005.[92] Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.[93][94] Shields herself called Cruise's comments ""a disservice to mothers everywhere.""[95] In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.[96] Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment.[89] It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.[97] Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.[98] YouTube video removal On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.[99][100] The Church of Scientology said the video had been ""pirated and edited"", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.[100][101] YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.[102] After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of November 2017, the video has achieved over 12 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.[103] Scientology's purported influence on Cruise's relationships In 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.[104] In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise's sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.[105] DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan.[106] Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.[107][108] The 2015 documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used Sea Org workers as a source of free labor.[109] In the film, Cruise's former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Tom Cruise's suggestion (which Cruise's lawyer denies).[110][111] Legacy Cruise and Katie Holmes interacting with fans in March 2006 In 2006, Premiere ranked Cruise as Hollywood's most powerful actor,[112] as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor.[113] The same year, Forbes magazine ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity.[114] The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and DiCaprio as the ""two stars, it doesn't matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.""[115] In August 2006, Paramount cited Cruise's ""recent conduct"" as the reason they did not renew their production contract with him.[116] In addition, Marketing Evaluations reported that Cruise's Q score (a measure of the popularity of celebrities), had fallen 40 percent.[117][118] October 10, 2006, was declared ""Tom Cruise Day"" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because he has made more trips to Japan than any other Hollywood star.[119] ""Tom Cruise Picture"" While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture. Some of Cruise's later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula. Widescreenings noted that for Tom Cruise's character Daniel Kaffee in A Few Good Men, screenwriter ""Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do."" Sorkin and director Rob Reiner are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee's potential in the film.[120] Litigation During Cruise's marriage to Nicole Kidman, the couple endured a great deal of public speculation about their sex life and rumors that Cruise was gay. In 1998, he successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.[121] In May 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had allegedly told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,[122] and in August 2001, Slater was ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default.[123] Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis, who alleged but never confirmed that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.[124] In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.[125] In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dropped due to statute of limitations.[126][127] In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch and Life & Style for defamation after the magazines claimed Cruise had ""abandoned"" his six-year-old daughter.[128] During deposition, Cruise acknowledged that 110 days had passed without him seeing her.

Situated 560 metres (1,837 feet) above sea level on the Deccan plateau on the right bank of the Mutha river,[14] Pune is the administrative headquarters of Pune district and was once the centre of power of the Maratha Empire established by Shivaji. In the 18th century, Pune was the political centre of the Indian subcontinent, as the seat of the Peshwas who were the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire.[15] Considered to be the cultural capital of Maharashtra,[16] Pune is known as ""Oxford of the East"" due to the presence of several well-known educational institutions in the city.[17][18] The city has emerged as a major educational hub in recent decades, with nearly half of the total international students in the country studying in Pune.[19] Since the 1950s and 1960s, Pune has had a traditional old-economic base as most of the old industries continue to grow. The city is known for its manufacturing and automobile industries, as well as for research institutes of information technology (IT), education, management and training, which attracts students, and professionals from India, South East Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Several colleges in Pune have student-exchange programs with colleges in Europe. The game of Badminton was developed in Pune and the game's earlier name was Poona.[20][21] Pune is one of the fastest growing cities in the Asia-Pacific region. The ‘Mercer 2017 Quality of Living Rankings’ evaluated living conditions in more than 440 cities around the world and ranked Pune at 145, second in India after Hyderabad at 144.[22] The same source highlights Pune among evolving business centres and nine emerging cities around the world with the citation ""Hosts IT and automotive companies"".[23] The 2017 Annual Survey of India’s City-Systems (ASICS) report release by Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, adjudged Pune as the best governed city amongst 23 major cities across 20 states [24]. Etymology The oldest reference to the place is found inscribed on a Rashtrakuta Dynasty copper plate dated AD 937, which refers to the town as Punya-Vishaya, meaning Sacred News.[25] By the 13th century, it had come to be known as Punawadi ().[26] History Early and medieval Copper plates dated 858 AD and 868 AD show that by the 8th century an agricultural settlement known as Punnaka existed where Pune is today. The plates indicate that this region was ruled by the Rashtrakuta dynasty. The Pataleshwar rock-cut temple complex was built during this era.[27] Pune was part of the territory ruled by Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri from the 9th century to 1327. In 1595, Maloji Raje Bhosale was granted the jagirdari (Fiefdom) of Pune by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Pune was ruled by the Ahmadnagar Sultanate until it was annexed by the Mughals in the 17th century. Maratha era Pune was part of the Jagir (fiefdom) granted to Maloji Bhosale in 1599 for his services to the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar.[28] His grandson, Shivaji, the founder of Maratha confederate, was born in Shivneri fort not far from Pune. Shivaji was brought up by his mother in Pune. Pune changed hands several times between the Mughals and the Marathas in the period between 1660 and 1705. When Chhatrapati Shahu succeeded to the Maratha throne in 1707, he wanted to declare Satara the capital but his chief administrators, the Peshwa who were the real power behind the throne, decided Pune was to be their headquarters. Bhosale Jahagir era After the destruction of the town in raids by the Adil Shahi dynasty in 1630 AD and again between 1636 AD and 1647 AD, Dadoji Konddeo, the successor to Dhadphale, oversaw the reconstruction of the town. He stabilised the revenue collection and administrative systems of areas around Pune and in neighbouring area of the Maval region. In addition, he developed effective methods to manage disputes and to enforce law and order.[29] Construction on the Lal Mahal began in 1631 AD. The Lal Mahal was completed in 1640 AD.[25] Jijabai is said to have commissioned the building of the Kasba Ganapati temple. The Ganesha idol consecrated at this temple has been regarded as the presiding deity (gramadevata) of the city.[30] During the 27-year-long conflict between the Marathas and the Mughals, the town was occupied by Aurangzeb from 1703 to 1705; during this time, the name of the town was changed to ""Muhiyabad"".[31] Two years later, once again the Marathas recaptured Sinhagad fort and later Pune from the Mughals. Peshwa rule An equestrian statue of Baji Rao I (  .) outside the Shaniwar Wada, who is credited with successful expansion of Maratha power in North India (circa 1730 CE)[32][33] In 1720, Baji Rao I was appointed Peshwa (Prime Minister) of the Maratha Empire by Chhatrapati Shahu.[35] He moved his base from Saswad to Pune in 1728 and, in the process, laid the foundation for turning what was a Kasbah into a large city.,[36][37] Bajirao also started construction of Shaniwar Wada on the right bank of the Mutha River The construction was completed in 1730, ushering in the era of Peshwa control of the city. The patronage of the Maratha Peshwas resulted in great expansion of Pune with the construction of around 250 temples and bridges in the city, including the Lakdi Pul and the temples on Parvati Hill.[38] Many of the Maruti, Vithoba, Vishnu, Mahadeo, Rama, Krishna and Ganesh temples were built during this era. The building of temples led to religion being responsible for about 15% of the city's economy during this period.,[39][40] Bajirao Peshwa constructed a lake at Katraj on the outskirts of the city and an underground aqueduct to bring water from the lake to Shaniwar Wada.[41] The aqueduct is still operational. Pune prospered as a city during the reign of Nanasaheb Peshwa. He developed Saras Baug, Heera Baug, Parvati Hill and new commercial, trading, and residential localities. Sadashiv Peth, Narayan Peth, Rasta Peth and Nana Peth were developed in this era. The Peshwa's influence in India declined after the defeat of Maratha forces in the Battle of Panipat but Pune remained the seat of power. In 1802, Pune was captured by Yashwantrao Holkar in the Battle of Pune, directly precipitating the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805. The Peshwa rule ended with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II by the British East India Company in 1818. British rule (1818–1947) The then Poona district 1896 The Third Anglo-Maratha War broke out between the Marathas and the British East India Company in 1817. The Peshwas were defeated at the Battle of Khadki (then spelled Kirkee) on 5 November near Pune and the city was seized by the British. It was placed under the administration of the Bombay Presidency and the British built a large military cantonment to the east of the city (now used by the Indian Army). The city was known as Poona during British rule. The Poona Municipality was established in 1858. A railway line from Bombay to the city opened in 1858, run by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR).[43][44] Navi Peth, Ganj Peth (now renamed Mahatma Phule Peth) were developed during the British Raj. Centre of social reform and nationalism Pune was prominently associated with the struggle for Indian independence. In the period between 1875 and 1910, the city was a major centre of agitation led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The city was also a centre for social reform led by Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, feminist Tarabai Shinde, Dhondo Keshav Karve and Pandita Ramabai. They demanded the abolition of caste prejudice, equal rights for women, harmony between the Hindu and Muslim communities, and better schools for the poor.[45] Mohandas Gandhi was imprisoned at Yerwada Central Jail several times and placed under house arrest at the Aga Khan Palace in 1942–44, where both his wife and aide Mahadev Desai died. Pune since Indian independence After Indian independence in 1947 from Britain, Pune saw a lot of development, such as the establishment of the National Defence Academy at Khadakwasla and the National Chemical Laboratory at Pashan. Pune serves as the headquarters of the Southern Command of the Indian Army.[46] Industrial development started in the 1950s and '60s in Hadapsar, Bhosari, Pimpri and Parvati.[47] Telco (now Tata Motors) started operations in 1961, which gave a huge boost to the automobile sector. In 1990, Pune began to attract foreign capital, particularly in the information technology and engineering industries. New businesses like floriculture, food processing, and wineries started to take root in and around the city. In 1998, work on the six-lane Mumbai-Pune expressway began, and was completed in 2001.[48] IT Parks were established in Aundh, Hinjawadi and Wagholi. In 2008, the Commonwealth Youth Games took place in Pune, which encouraged additional development in the northwest region of the city.[49] On 13 February 2010, a bomb exploded at the German Bakery in the upmarket Koregaon Park neighbourhood on the east side of Pune, killing 17 and injuring 60.[50] The explosion is now suspected to be an IED using an ammonium nitrate fuel oil mix.[51] The blast was a first in what was until then the relatively safe environment of Pune.[52] Geography Aerial view of Pune near its airport Pune is at a height of 560 m (1,840 ft) above sea level on the western margin of the Deccan plateau. It is on the leeward side of the Sahyadri mountain ranges, which forms a barrier from the Arabian Sea. It is a hilly city, with its highest hill, Vetal Hill, rising to 800 m (2,600 ft) above sea level. Just outside the city, the Sinhagad fort is at an altitude of 1,300 metres (4,300 feet).

Central Pune is at the confluence of the Mula and Mutha Rivers. The Pavana and Indrayani Rivers, tributaries of the Bhima River, traverse the northwestern outskirts of metropolitan Pune. The city's total area is 729 square kilometres (281 square miles). Seismology Pune lies very close to the seismically active zone around Koyna Dam, about 100 km (62 mi) south of the city, and has been rated in Zone 3 (on a scale of 2 to 5, with 5 being the most prone to earthquakes) by the India Meteorological Department. Pune has experienced some moderate- and many low-intensity earthquakes in its history. Climate Pune has a hot semi-arid climate (BSh) bordering with tropical wet and dry (Aw) with average temperatures ranging between 19 to 33 °C (66 to 91 °F). Pune experiences three seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter. Typical summer months are from mid-March to June often extending until 15 June, with maximum temperatures sometimes reaching 42 °C (108 °F). The warmest month in Pune is May; although summer doesn't end until mid-June. The city often receives heavy dusty winds in May (and humidity remains high). Even during the hottest months, the nights are usually cool due to Pune's high altitude.

The migrating population rose from 43,900 in 2001 to 88,200 in 2005.[59] The estimated population in 2016 for the Pune metro region is 6,226,959. According to the Pune Municipal Corporation, 40% of the population lived in slums in 2001.[60] The sharp increase in censorial decade of 1991–2001 can be attributed to the absorption of 38 fringe villages into the city.[61] The average literacy rate of Pune was 86.15 in 2011 compared to 80.45 in 2001.[62][63] Marathi is the official and most widely spoken language, while English, Hindi and Kannada are understood by a significant part of the population. Since Pune is a major industrial metropolis, it has attracted migrants from all parts of India to come and settle here. The top five areas of migration are Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. The Sindhis in the city are mostly refugees and their descendants, who came to the area after the partition of India in 1947.[64] They settled in Pimpri area initially and are still present there in large numbers, however they are also present in the rest of the city.[65] As the agriculture has dwindled in recent decades, immigration from erstwhile tribal peoples now accounts for seventy percent of population growth and education syllabi have not adjusted in accordance with other industrialised regions.[66][67] Religion Hinduism is the dominant religion in Pune. Major communities by religion include Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Zoroashtrians. Many Temples, Churches, Mosque, Gurudwaras, Buddhist Viharas, Jewish synagogues, Jain temples, Zoroashtrian Fire Temples and other religious buildings are found throughout the city.[68] Islam is the second largest religion in Pune.[69] Pune has a large number of Mosques, the most prominent of which are Chand Tara Masjid, Jaama Masjid, and Azam Campus Masjid.

The Camp Gurudwara is one of the main gurudwaras, with hundreds of people visiting it every day. It is named as ""Guru Nanak Darbar"" and some people also call it ""Hollywood Gurudwara"". This complex includes a charitable hospital, community kitchen for Langar and Sarai for refugees.[73] Urban structure A crowded street in Pune in 2004 The new Pune suburb of Baner The modern city of Pune has many distinct neighbourhoods.These includes the numerous peths of the old city on the East bank of the Mutha river,the British built cantonment areas of Khadki and Pune, old suburbs such as Deccan Gymkhana and the newer ones such as Kothrud on the west bank of the Mutha river. The Pune metropolitan area was defined in 1967. It includes Pune, the three cantonment areas,and villages then on the fringe.Industrial developments started in the 1950s in the outlining areas of the city such as Hadapsar in the east, and Bhosari, and Pimpri in the west respectively.[47] The industrial growth in the Pimpri Chinchwad and Bhosari areas allowed these areas to incorporate as the separate city of Pimpri-Chinchwad.[74][75] Many other villages on the fringe have been absorbed by the cities of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad in recent decades.Some of the villages included in the metropolitan area have now grown into fully fledged suburbs such as Kothrud, Katraj, Hadapsar, Hinjawadi,Aundh and Baner[76] The Panshet Dam flood of 1961 damaged or destroyed a lot of old housing close to the river bank in the Narayan, Shanwar and Kasba peth areas of the city.However,the traditional houses in the city center, the ‘wadas’ and the ‘chawls’ still have significant percentage of population residing in them.[77] The damage caused by the 1961 disaster spurred development of new suburbs and housing complexes in the city such as Maharshinagar, Sahakarnagar, and Lokmanyanagar to the south of the old city and Gokhalenagar to the west of the city.[78] The rapid industrialization since the 1960s has led to huge influx of new people to the city with housing supply not keeping pace with demand and therefore there has been a great increase in slum dwellings.[79] Approximately 36% of the population is living in 486 slum areas.Out of these, 55% of slum households have in-house toilet facilities and 90% have electricity connection.One third of slums are on mixed ownership land. Overall, the living conditions in slums vary considerably, depending on their status (formal/informal) and in how far NGOs, CBOs and government facilities are involved and committed to improving the local living conditions.[77] In the post-Panshet period since early 1960s, new housing has been in the form of bungalows and apartment buildings.However, in the last twenty years, due to heavy demand for housing there is a trend towards knocking down bungalows and converting them into multi-storey apartment buildings under co-operative housing societies.[77] The consequent increase in population density has led to severe pressure on utilities such as water supply.[80] Since the 1990s,a number of integrated townships and gated communities[81] have come into being on the outskirts of the city on former agriculture land such as Magarpatta, Nanded, Amanora, Blue Ridge, Life Republic, and Lavasa. Most of these were built by private developers and also managed privately.Besides housing, they offer business opportunities and access to infrastructure, which (by law) has to be significantly better than in the rest of the city, e.g., with 24/7 provision of electricity and water. The largest and most prestigious of these townships, Magarpatta City, was developed by a local farmers’ community and described as ‘self-sustainable ecological habitat.Integrated townships provide essential infrastructure services like schools, health care and recreational facilities.According to PMC,six townships with up to 15,000 housing units already existed in Pune in 2012 and 25 more were in the planning process.[77] Peths in Pune Peth is a general term, in the Marathi language, for a locality in the Indian city of Pune. Up to seventeen peths are located in central Pune, and were mostly established during the Maratha empire era under the Peshwa rule of the city in the 18th century. Seven of them are named after the days of the week in Marathi: traders and craftsmen in a given locality mainly conducted business only on that day of the week. Today the peths form the heart of Pune city, and are referred to as the old city, or simply city. They are considered to be the cultural heart of Pune.

Ltd., and other Kirloskar companies are based in Pune. The Hinjawadi IT Park (officially called the Rajeev Gandhi IT Park) is a project being started by MIDC to house the IT sector in Pune. When completed, the Hinjawadi IT Park is expected to encompass an area of about 2,800 acres (11 km2). The estimated investment in the project is 600 billion (US$9.2 billion).[89] To facilitate economic growth, the government made liberal incentives in its IT and ITES Policy, 2003 and leased properties on MIDC land.[90] The IT sector employs more than 70,000 people. Software giant Microsoft intends to set up a 7 billion (US$110 million) project in Hinjawadi.[90] World Trade Centre in Pune, Maharashtra Pune Food Cluster development project is an initiative funded by the World Bank.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha,"Ganesha (/ne/; Sanskrit: , Gaea;  listen (help·info)), also known as Ganapati, Vinayaka, Pillaiyar and Binayak, is one of the best-known and most worshiped deities in the Hindu pantheon.[4] His image is found throughout India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Nepal.[5] Hindu denominations worship him regardless of affiliations.[6] Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists.[7] Although he is known by many attributes, Ganesha's elephant head makes him easy to identify.[8] Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles,[9] the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom.[10] As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rites and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions.[11][2] Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits and explain his distinct iconography. Ganesha likely emerged as a deity as early as the 2nd century AD,[12] but most certainly by the 4th and 5th centuries AD, during the Gupta period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors.[13] Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions.[14][15] In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity.[16] The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha. Etymology and other names[edit] Ganesha, Madhya Pradesh, c. 750, India Ganesha has been ascribed many other titles and epithets, including Ganapati (Ganpati) and Vighneshvara. The Hindu title of respect Shri (Sanskrit: ; IAST: r; also spelled Sri or Shree) is often added before his name. The name Ganesha is a Sanskrit compound, joining the words gana (gaa), meaning a group, multitude, or categorical system and isha (a), meaning lord or master.[17] The word gaa when associated with Ganesha is often taken to refer to the gaas, a troop of semi-divine beings that form part of the retinue of Shiva, Ganesha's father.[18] The term more generally means a category, class, community, association, or corporation.[19] Some commentators interpret the name ""Lord of the Gaas"" to mean ""Lord of Hosts"" or ""Lord of created categories"", such as the elements.[20] Ganapati (; gaapati), a synonym for Ganesha, is a compound composed of gaa, meaning ""group"", and pati, meaning ""ruler"" or ""lord"".[19] Though the earliest mention of the word Ganapati is found in hymn 2.23.1 of the 2nd-millennium BCE Rigveda, it is however uncertain that the Vedic term referred specifically to Ganesha.[21][22] The Amarakosha,[23] an early Sanskrit lexicon, lists eight synonyms of Ganesha: Vinayaka, Vighnarja (equivalent to Vighnesha), Dvaimtura (one who has two mothers),[24] Gadhipa (equivalent to Ganapati and Ganesha), Ekadanta (one who has one tusk), Heramba, Lambodara (one who has a pot belly, or, literally, one who has a hanging belly), and Gajanana (gajnana); having the face of an elephant.[25] Vinayaka (; vinyaka) is a common name for Ganesha that appears in the Puras and in Buddhist Tantras.[26] This name is reflected in the naming of the eight famous Ganesha temples in Maharashtra known as the Ashtavinayak (Marathi: , aavinyaka).[27] The names Vighnesha (; vighnea) and Vighneshvara (; vighnevara) (Lord of Obstacles)[28] refers to his primary function in Hinduism as the master and remover of obstacles (vighna).[29] A prominent name for Ganesha in the Tamil language is Pillai (Tamil: ) or Pillaiyar ().[30] A. K. Narain differentiates these terms by saying that pillai means a ""child"" while pillaiyar means a ""noble child"". He adds that the words pallu, pella, and pell in the Dravidian family of languages signify ""tooth or tusk"", also ""elephant tooth or tusk"".[31] Anita Raina Thapan notes that the root word pille in the name Pillaiyar might have originally meant ""the young of the elephant"", because the Pali word pillaka means ""a young elephant"".[32] In the Burmese language, Ganesha is known as Maha Peinne (, pronounced [mhà pèiné]), derived from Pali Mah Winyaka ().[33] The widespread name of Ganesha in Thailand is Phra Phikanet.[34] The earliest images and mention of Ganesha names as a major deity in present-day Indonesia,[35] Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam date from the 7th- and 8th-centuries,[36] and these mirror Indian examples of the 5th century or earlier.[37] In Sri Lankan Singhala Buddhist areas he is known as Gana deviyo, and revered along with Buddha, Vishnu, Skanda and others.[38] Iconography[edit] Ganesha is a popular figure in Indian art.[39] Unlike those of some deities, representations of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time.[40] He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, sitting down or on an elevated seat, or engaging in a range of contemporary situations. Ganesha images were prevalent in many parts of India by the 6th century.[41] The 13th-century statue pictured is typical of Ganesha statuary from 900–1200, after Ganesha had been well-established as an independent deity with his own sect. This example features some of Ganesha's common iconographic elements. A virtually identical statue has been dated between 973–1200 by Paul Martin-Dubost,[42] and another similar statue is dated c. 12th century by Pratapaditya Pal.[43] Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a big belly. This statue has four arms, which is common in depictions of Ganesha. He holds his own broken tusk in his lower-right hand and holds a delicacy, which he samples with his trunk, in his lower-left hand. The motif of Ganesha turning his trunk sharply to his left to taste a sweet in his lower-left hand is a particularly archaic feature.[44] A more primitive statue in one of the Ellora Caves with this general form has been dated to the 7th century.[45] Details of the other hands are difficult to make out on the statue shown. In the standard configuration, Ganesha typically holds an axe or a goad in one upper arm and a pasha (noose) in the other upper arm. In rare instances, he may be depicted with a human head.[46] The influence of this old constellation of iconographic elements can still be seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer in a gesture of protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra).[47] The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, which is a very popular theme.[48] Common attributes[edit] A typical four-armed form. Miniature of Nurpur school (circa 1810)[49] Ganesha has been represented with the head of an elephant since the early stages of his appearance in Indian art.[50] Puranic myths provide many explanations for how he got his elephant head.[51] One of his popular forms, Heramba-Ganapati, has five elephant heads, and other less-common variations in the number of heads are known.[52] While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head, he acquires the head later in most stories.[53] The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was created by Parvati using clay to protect her and Shiva beheaded him when Ganesha came between Shiva and Parvati. Shiva then replaced Ganesha's original head with that of an elephant.[54] Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from varying from source to source.[55][56] Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's laughter. Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly.[57] Ganesha's earliest name was Ekadanta (One Tusked), referring to his single whole tusk, the other being broken.[58] Some of the earliest images of Ganesha show him holding his broken tusk.[59] The importance of this distinctive feature is reflected in the Mudgala Purana, which states that the name of Ganesha's second incarnation is Ekadanta.[60] Ganesha's protruding belly appears as a distinctive attribute in his earliest statuary, which dates to the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries).[61] This feature is so important that according to the Mudgala Purana, two different incarnations of Ganesha use names based on it: Lambodara (Pot Belly, or, literally, Hanging Belly) and Mahodara (Great Belly).[62] Both names are Sanskrit compounds describing his belly (IAST: udara).[63] The Brahmanda Purana says that Ganesha has the name Lambodara because all the universes (i.e., cosmic eggs; IAST: brahmas) of the past, present, and future are present in him.[64] The number of Ganesha's arms varies; his best-known forms have between two and sixteen arms.[65] Many depictions of Ganesha feature four arms, which is mentioned in Puranic sources and codified as a standard form in some iconographic texts.[66] His earliest images had two arms.[67] Forms with 14 and 20 arms appeared in Central India during the 9th and the 10th centuries.[68] The serpent is a common feature in Ganesha iconography and appears in many forms.[69] According to the Ganesha Purana, Ganesha wrapped the serpent Vasuki around his neck.[70] Other depictions of snakes include use as a sacred thread (IAST: yajñyopavta)[71] wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a throne. Upon Ganesha's forehead may be a third eye or the sectarian mark (IAST: tilaka), which consists of three horizontal lines.[72] The Ganesha Purana prescribes a tilaka mark as well as a crescent moon on the forehead.[73] A distinct form of Ganesha called Bhalachandra (IAST: bhlacandra; ""Moon on the Forehead"") includes that iconographic element.[74] Ganesha is often described as red in color.[75] Specific colors are associated with certain forms.[76] Many examples of color associations with specific meditation forms are prescribed in the Sritattvanidhi, a treatise on Hindu iconography. For example, white is associated with his representations as Heramba-Ganapati and Rina-Mochana-Ganapati (Ganapati Who Releases from Bondage).[77] Ekadanta-Ganapati is visualized as blue during meditation in that form.[78] Vahanas[edit] The earliest Ganesha images are without a vahana (mount/vehicle).[79] Of the eight incarnations of Ganesha described in the Mudgala Purana, Ganesha uses a mouse (shrew) in five of them, a lion in his incarnation as Vakratunda, a peacock in his incarnation as Vikata, and Shesha, the divine serpent, in his incarnation as Vighnaraja.[80] Mohotkata uses a lion, Mayrevara uses a peacock, Dhumraketu uses a horse, and Gajanana uses a mouse, in the four incarnations of Ganesha listed in the Ganesha Purana. Jain depictions of Ganesha show his vahana variously as a mouse, elephant, tortoise, ram, or peacock.[81] Ganesha is often shown riding on or attended by a mouse, shrew or rat.[82] Martin-Dubost says that the rat began to appear as the principal vehicle in sculptures of Ganesha in central and western India during the 7th century; the rat was always placed close to his feet.[83] The mouse as a mount first appears in written sources in the Matsya Purana and later in the Brahmananda Purana and Ganesha Purana, where Ganesha uses it as his vehicle in his last incarnation.[84] The Ganapati Atharvashirsa includes a meditation verse on Ganesha that describes the mouse appearing on his flag.[85] The names Makavhana (mouse-mount) and khuketana (rat-banner) appear in the Ganesha Sahasranama.[86] The mouse is interpreted in several ways. According to Grimes, ""Many, if not most of those who interpret Gaapati's mouse, do so negatively; it symbolizes tamogua as well as desire"".[87] Along these lines, Michael Wilcockson says it symbolizes those who wish to overcome desires and be less selfish.[88] Krishan notes that the rat is destructive and a menace to crops. The Sanskrit word maka (mouse) is derived from the root m (stealing, robbing). It was essential to subdue the rat as a destructive pest, a type of vighna (impediment) that needed to be overcome. According to this theory, showing Ganesha as master of the rat demonstrates his function as Vigneshvara (Lord of Obstacles) and gives evidence of his possible role as a folk grma-devat (village deity) who later rose to greater prominence.[89] Martin-Dubost notes a view that the rat is a symbol suggesting that Ganesha, like the rat, penetrates even the most secret places.[90] Features[edit] Heramba-Ganesha with consort, 18th century Nepal Removal of obstacles[edit] Ganesha is Vighneshvara or Vighnaraja or Vighnaharta (Marathi), the Lord of Obstacles, both of a material and spiritual order.[91] He is popularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles, though traditionally he also places obstacles in the path of those who need to be checked. Paul Courtright says that ""his task in the divine scheme of things, his dharma, is to place and remove obstacles. It is his particular territory, the reason for his creation.""[92] Krishan notes that some of Ganesha's names reflect shadings of multiple roles that have evolved over time.[29] Dhavalikar ascribes the quick ascension of Ganesha in the Hindu pantheon, and the emergence of the Ganapatyas, to this shift in emphasis from vighnakart (obstacle-creator) to vighnahart (obstacle-averter).[93] However, both functions continue to be vital to his character.[94] Buddhi (Knowledge)[edit] Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of letters and learning.[95] In Sanskrit, the word buddhi is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence, wisdom, or intellect.[96] The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha, especially in the Puranic period, when many stories stress his cleverness and love of intelligence. One of Ganesha's names in the Ganesha Purana and the Ganesha Sahasranama is Buddhipriya.[97] This name also appears in a list of 21 names at the end of the Ganesha Sahasranama that Ganesha says are especially important.[98] The word priya can mean ""fond of"", and in a marital context it can mean ""lover"" or ""husband"",[99] so the name may mean either ""Fond of Intelligence"" or ""Buddhi's Husband"".[100] Ganesha, Chola period, early 13th century. Ganesha is identified with the Hindu mantra Aum, also spelled Om. The term okrasvarpa (Aum is his form), when identified with Ganesha, refers to the notion that he personifies the primal sound.[101] The Ganapati Atharvashirsa attests to this association. Chinmayananda translates the relevant passage as follows:[102] (O Lord Ganapati!) You are (the Trimurti) Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesa. You are Indra. You are fire [Agni] and air [Vyu]. You are the sun [Srya] and the moon [Chandrama]. You are Brahman. You are (the three worlds) Bhuloka [earth], Antariksha-loka [space], and Swargaloka [heaven]. You are Om. (That is to say, You are all this). Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha's body in iconography and the shape of Aum in the Devangar and Tamil scripts.[103] First chakra[edit] According to Kundalini yoga, Ganesha resides in the first chakra, called Muladhara (mldhra). Mula means ""original, main""; adhara means ""base, foundation"". The muladhara chakra is the principle on which the manifestation or outward expansion of primordial Divine Force rests.[104] This association is also attested to in the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Courtright translates this passage as follows: ""You continually dwell in the sacral plexus at the base of the spine [mldhra cakra].""[105] Thus, Ganesha has a permanent abode in every being at the Muladhara.[106] Ganesha holds, supports and guides all other chakras, thereby ""governing the forces that propel the wheel of life"".[104] Family and consorts[edit] Shiva and Parvati giving a bath to Ganesha. Kangra miniature, 18th century. Allahabad Museum, New Delhi.[107] Though Ganesha is popularly held to be the son of Shiva and Parvati, the Puranic myths give different versions about his birth.[108] In some he was created by Parvati,[109] in another he was created by Shiva and Parvati,[110] in another he appeared mysteriously and was discovered by Shiva and Parvati[111] or he was born from the elephant headed goddess Malini after she drank Parvati's bath water that had been thrown in the river.[112] The family includes his brother, the god of war, Kartikeya, who is also called Skanda and Murugan.[113] Regional differences dictate the order of their births. In northern India, Skanda is generally said to be the elder, while in the south, Ganesha is considered the firstborn.[114] In northern India, Skanda was an important martial deity from about 500 BCE to about 600 CE, after which worship of him declined significantly. As Skanda fell, Ganesha rose. Several stories tell of sibling rivalry between the brothers[115] and may reflect sectarian tensions.[116] Ganesha's marital status, the subject of considerable scholarly review, varies widely in mythological stories.[117] One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried brahmachari.[118] This view is common in southern India and parts of northern India.[119] Another pattern associates him with the concepts of Buddhi (intellect), Siddhi (spiritual power), and Riddhi (prosperity); these qualities are sometimes personified as goddesses, said to be Ganesha's wives.[120] He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant (Sanskrit: dai).[121] Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts, Sarasvati or arda (particularly in Maharashtra).[122] He is also associated with the goddess of luck and prosperity, Lakshmi.[123] Another pattern, mainly prevalent in the Bengal region, links Ganesha with the banana tree, Kala Bo.[124] The Shiva Purana says that Ganesha had begotten two sons: Kema (prosperity) and Lbha (profit). In northern Indian variants of this story, the sons are often said to be ubha (auspiciouness) and Lbha.[125] The 1975 Hindi film Jai Santoshi Maa shows Ganesha married to Riddhi and Siddhi and having a daughter named Santoshi Ma, the goddess of satisfaction. This story has no Puranic basis, but Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen cite Santoshi Ma's cult as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.[126] Worship and festivals[edit] Ganesha is worshipped on many religious and secular occasions, especially at the beginning of ventures such as buying a vehicle or starting a business.[127] K.N. Somayaji says, ""there can hardly be a [Hindu] home [in India] which does not house an idol of Ganapati. ... Ganapati, being the most popular deity in India, is worshipped by almost all castes and in all parts of the country"".[128] Devotees believe that if Ganesha is propitiated, he grants success, prosperity and protection against adversity.[129] Ganesha is a non-sectarian deity. Hindus of all denominations invoke him at the beginning of prayers, important undertakings, and religious ceremonies.[130] Dancers and musicians, particularly in southern India, begin art performances such as the Bharatnatyam dance with a prayer to Ganesha.[75] Mantras such as Om Shri Gaeshya Namah (Om, salutation to the Illustrious Ganesha) are often used. One of the most famous mantras associated with Ganesha is Om Ga Ganapataye Namah (Om, Ga, Salutation to the Lord of Hosts).[131] Devotees offer Ganesha sweets such as modaka and small sweet balls called laddus.[132] He is often shown carrying a bowl of sweets, called a modakaptra.[133] Because of his identification with the color red, he is often worshipped with red sandalwood paste (raktachandana)[134] or red flowers. Drv grass (Cynodon dactylon) and other materials are also used in his worship.[135] Festivals associated with Ganesh are Ganesh Chaturthi or Vinyaka chaturth in the uklapaka (the fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of Bhadrapada (August/September) and the Ganesh Jayanti (Ganesha's birthday) celebrated on the cathurth of the uklapaka (fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of magha (January/February).""[136] Ganesha Chaturthi[edit] An annual festival honours Ganesha for ten days, starting on Ganesha Chaturthi, which typically falls in late August or early September.[137] The festival begins with people bringing in clay idols of Ganesha, symbolising Ganesha's visit. The festival culminates on the day of Ananta Chaturdashi, when idols (murtis) of Ganesha are immersed in the most convenient body of water.[138] Some families have a tradition of immersion on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 7th day. In 1893, Lokmanya Tilak transformed this annual Ganesha festival from private family celebrations into a grand public event.[139] He did so ""to bridge the gap between the Brahmins and the non-Brahmins and find an appropriate context in which to build a new grassroots unity between them"" in his nationalistic strivings against the British in Maharashtra.[140] Because of Ganesha's wide appeal as ""the god for Everyman"", Tilak chose him as a rallying point for Indian protest against British rule.[141] Tilak was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in pavilions, and he established the practice of submerging all the public images on the tenth day.[142] Today, Hindus across India celebrate the Ganapati festival with great fervour, though it is most popular in the state of Maharashtra.[143][144] The festival also assumes huge proportions in Mumbai, Pune, and in the surrounding belt of Ashtavinayaka temples. Temples[edit] In Hindu temples, Ganesha is depicted in various ways: as an acolyte or subordinate deity (pãrva-devatã); as a deity related to the principal deity (parivra-devatã); or as the principal deity of the temple (pradhna), treated similarly to the highest gods of the Hindu pantheon.[145] As the god of transitions, he is placed at the doorway of many Hindu temples to keep out the unworthy, which is analogous to his role as Parvati’s doorkeeper.[146] In addition, several shrines are dedicated to Ganesha himself, of which the Ashtavinayak (Sanskrit: ; aavinyaka; lit. ""eight Ganesha (shrines)"") in Maharashtra are particularly well known. Located within a 100-kilometer radius of the city of Pune, each of the eight shrines celebrates a particular form of Ganapati, complete with its own lore and legend.[147] The eight shrines are: Morgaon, Siddhatek, Pali, Mahad, Theur, Lenyadri, Ozar and Ranjangaon. There are many other important Ganesha temples at the following locations: Wai in Maharashtra; Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh; Jodhpur, Nagaur and Raipur (Pali) in Rajasthan; Baidyanath in Bihar; Baroda, Dholaka, and Valsad in Gujarat and Dhundiraj Temple in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Prominent Ganesha temples in southern India include the following: the Rockfort Ucchi Pillayar Temple at Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu; Kottarakara, Pazhavangadi, Kasargod in Kerala; Hampi, and Idagunji in Karnataka; and Bhadrachalam in Telangana.[148] T. A. Gopinatha notes, ""Every village however small has its own image of Vighnevara (Vigneshvara) with or without a temple to house it in. At entrances of villages and forts, below ppaa (Sacred fig) trees ... in a niche ... in temples of Viu (Vishnu) as well as iva (Shiva) and also in separate shrines specially constructed in iva temples ... the figure of Vighnevara is invariably seen.""[149] Ganesha temples have also been built outside of India, including Southeast Asia, Nepal (including the four Vinayaka shrines in the Kathmandu valley),[150] and in several western countries.[151] Rise to prominence[edit] First appearance[edit] 7th- to 8th-century Ganesha sculpture from Cham dynasty, Vietnam.[152] Ganesha appeared in his classic form as a clearly-recognizable deity with well-defined iconographic attributes in the early 4th to 5th centuries CE.[153] Some of the earliest known Ganesha images include two images found in eastern Afghanistan. The first image was discovered in the ruins north of Kabul along with those of Surya and Shiva. It is dated to the 4th-century.[154] The second image found in Gardez has an inscription on Ganesha pedestal that has helped date it to the 5th-century.[154] Another Ganesha sculpture is embedded in the walls of Cave 6 of the Udayagiri Caves in Madhya Pradesh. This is dated to the 5th-century.[154] An early iconic image of Ganesha with elephant head, a bowl of sweets and a goddess sitting in his lap has been found in the ruins of the Bhumara Temple in Madhya Pradesh, and this is dated to the 5th-century Gupta period.[155][154][156] Other recent discoveries, such as one from Ramgarh Hill, are also dated to the 4th or 5th centuries.[154] An independent cult with Ganesha as the primary deity was well established by about the 10th century.[153] Narain summarizes the lack of evidence about Ganesha's history before the 5th century as follows:[153] What is inscrutable is the somewhat dramatic appearance of Gaea on the historical scene. His antecedents are not clear. His wide acceptance and popularity, which transcend sectarian and territorial limits, are indeed amazing. On the one hand, there is the pious belief of the orthodox devotees in Gaea's Vedic origins and in the Puric explanations contained in the confusing, but nonetheless interesting, mythology. On the other hand, there are doubts about the existence of the idea and the icon of this deity"" before the fourth to fifth century A.D. ... [I]n my opinion, indeed there is no convincing evidence [in ancient Brahmanic literature] of the existence of this divinity prior to the fifth century. The evidence for more ancient Ganesha, suggests Narain, may reside outside Brahmanic or Sanskritic traditions, or outside geocultural boundaries of India.[153] Ganesha appears in China by the 6th century, states Brown,[157] and his artistic images in temple setting as ""remover of obstacles"" in South Asia appear by about 400 CE.[158] He is, states Bailey, recognized as goddess Parvati's son and integrated into Shaivism theology by early centuries of the common era.[159] Possible influences[edit] Courtright reviews various speculative theories about the early history of Ganesha, including supposed tribal traditions and animal cults, and dismisses all of them in this way:[160] In this search for a historical origin for Gaea, some have suggested precise locations outside the Brhmaic tradition.... These historical locations are intriguing to be sure, but the fact remains that they are all speculations, variations on the Dravidian hypothesis, which argues that anything not attested to in the Vedic and Indo-European sources must have come into Brhmaic religion from the Dravidian or aboriginal populations of India as part of the process that produced Hinduism out of the interactions of the Aryan and non-Aryan populations. There is no independent evidence for an elephant cult or a totem; nor is there any archaeological data pointing to a tradition prior to what we can already see in place in the Puric literature and the iconography of Gaea. Thapan's book on the development of Ganesha devotes a chapter to speculations about the role elephants had in early India but concludes that ""although by the second century CE the elephant-headed yaka form exists it cannot be presumed to represent Gaapati-Vinyaka. There is no evidence of a deity by this name having an elephant or elephant-headed form at this early stage. Gaapati-Vinyaka had yet to make his debut.""[161] Some have noted the roots of Ganesha worship, dating back to 3,000 BCE[162] since the times of Indus Valley Civilization.[163] In 1993, a metal plate depiction of an elephant-headed figure, interpreted as Ganesha, was discovered in Lorestan Province, Iran, dating back to 1,200 BCE.[164][165] First terracotta images of Ganesha are from 1st century CE found in Ter, Pal, Verrapuram, and Chandraketugarh. These figures are small, with elephant head, two arms, and chubby physique.[166] The earliest Ganesha icons in stone were carved in Mathura during Kushan times (2nd-3rd centuries CE).[166] One theory of the origin of Ganesha is that he gradually came to prominence in connection with the four Vinayakas (Vinyakas).[167] In Hindu mythology, the Vinyakas were a group of four troublesome demons who created obstacles and difficulties[168] but who were easily propitiated.[169] The name Vinyaka is a common name for Ganesha both in the Puras and in Buddhist Tantras.[26] Krishan is one of the academics who accept this view, stating flatly of Ganesha, ""He is a non-Vedic god. His origin is to be traced to the four Vinyakas, evil spirits, of the Mnavaghyastra (7th–4th century BCE) who cause various types of evil and suffering"".[170] Depictions of elephant-headed human figures, which some identify with Ganesha, appear in Indian art and coinage as early as the 2nd century.[171] According to Ellawala, the elephant-headed Ganesha as lord of the Ganas was known to the people of Sri Lanka in the early pre-Christian era.[172] Vedic and epic literature[edit] 17th century RajasthanI manuscript of the Mahabharata depicting Vyasa narrating the Mahabharata to Ganesha, who serves as the scribe The title ""Leader of the group"" (Sanskrit: gaapati) occurs twice in the Rig Veda, but in neither case does it refer to the modern Ganesha. The term appears in RV 2.23.1 as a title for Brahmanaspati, according to commentators.[173] While this verse doubtless refers to Brahmanaspati, it was later adopted for worship of Ganesha and is still used today.[174] In rejecting any claim that this passage is evidence of Ganesha in the Rig Veda, Ludo Rocher says that it ""clearly refers to Bhaspati—who is the deity of the hymn—and Bhaspati only"".[175] Equally clearly, the second passage (RV 10.112.9) refers to Indra,[176] who is given the epithet 'gaapati', translated ""Lord of the companies (of the Maruts).""[177] However, Rocher notes that the more recent Ganapatya literature often quotes the Rigvedic verses to give Vedic respectability to Ganesha.[178] Two verses in texts belonging to Black Yajurveda, Maitryaya Sahit (2.9.1)[179] and Taittirya rayaka (10.1),[180] appeal to a deity as ""the tusked one"" (Danti), ""elephant-faced"" (Hastimukha), and ""with a curved trunk"" (Vakratua). These names are suggestive of Ganesha, and the 14th century commentator Sayana explicitly establishes this identification.[181] The description of Dantin, possessing a twisted trunk (vakratua) and holding a corn-sheaf, a sugar cane,[182] and a club,[183] is so characteristic of the Puranic Ganapati that Heras says ""we cannot resist to accept his full identification with this Vedic Dantin"".[184] However, Krishan considers these hymns to be post-Vedic additions.[185] Thapan reports that these passages are ""generally considered to have been interpolated"". Dhavalikar says, ""the references to the elephant-headed deity in the Maitrya Sahit have been proven to be very late interpolations, and thus are not very helpful for determining the early formation of the deity"".[186] Ganesha does not appear in the Indian epic literature that is dated to the Vedic period. A late interpolation to the epic poem Mahabharata says that the sage Vyasa (Vysa) asked Ganesha to serve as his scribe to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed but only on condition that Vyasa recites the poem uninterrupted, that is, without pausing. The sage agreed but found that to get any rest he needed to recite very complex passages so Ganesha would have to ask for clarifications. The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the Mahabharata,[187] in which the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote in an appendix.[188] The story of Ganesha acting as the scribe occurs in 37 of the 59 manuscripts consulted during preparation of the critical edition.[189] Ganesha's association with mental agility and learning is one reason he is shown as scribe for Vysa's dictation of the Mahabharata in this interpolation.[190] Richard L. Brown dates the story to the 8th century, and Moriz Winternitz concludes that it was known as early as c. 900, but it was not added to the Mahabharata some 150 years later. Winternitz also notes that a distinctive feature in South Indian manuscripts of the Mahabharata is their omission of this Ganesha legend.[191] The term vinyaka is found in some recensions of the ntiparva and Anusanaparva that are regarded as interpolations.[192] A reference to Vighnakartm (""Creator of Obstacles"") in Vanaparva is also believed to be an interpolation and does not appear in the critical edition.[193] Puranic period[edit] Tanjore-style painting of Ganesha Stories about Ganesha often occur in the Puranic corpus. Brown notes while the Puranas ""defy precise chronological ordering"", the more detailed narratives of Ganesha's life are in the late texts, c. 600–1300.[194] Yuvraj Krishan says that the Puranic myths about the birth of Ganesha and how he acquired an elephant's head are in the later Puranas, which were composed of c. 600 onwards. He elaborates on the matter to say that references to Ganesha in the earlier Puranas, such as the Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas, are later interpolations made during the 7th to 10th centuries.[195] In his survey of Ganesha's rise to prominence in Sanskrit literature, Ludo Rocher notes that:[196] Above all, one cannot help being struck by the fact that the numerous stories surrounding Gaea concentrate on an unexpectedly limited number of incidents. These incidents are mainly three: his birth and parenthood, his elephant head, and his single tusk. Other incidents are touched on in the texts, but to a far lesser extent. Ganesha's rise to prominence was codified in the 9th century when he was formally included as one of the five primary deities of Smartism. The 9th-century philosopher Adi Shankara popularized the ""worship of the five forms"" (Panchayatana puja) system among orthodox Brahmins of the Smarta tradition.[197] This worship practice invokes the five deities Ganesha, Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, and Surya.[198] Adi Shankara instituted the tradition primarily to unite the principal deities of these five major sects on an equal status. This formalized the role of Ganesha as a complementary deity. Scriptures[edit] Ganesha statue in 9th century Prambanan temple, Java, Indonesia Once Ganesha was accepted as one of the five principal deities of Brahmanism, some Brahmins chose Ganesha as their principal deity. They developed the Ganapatya tradition, as seen in the Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana.[199] The date of composition for the Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana—and their dating relative to one another—has sparked academic debate. Both works were developed over time and contain age-layered strata. Anita Thapan reviews comment about dating and provide her own judgment. ""It seems likely that the core of the Ganesha Purana appeared around the twelfth and thirteenth centuries"", she says, ""but was later interpolated.""[200] Lawrence W. Preston considers the most reasonable date for the Ganesha Purana to be between 1100 and 1400, which coincides with the apparent age of the sacred sites mentioned by the text.[201] R.C. Hazra suggests that the Mudgala Purana is older than the Ganesha Purana, which he dates between 1100 and 1400.[202] However, Phyllis Granoff finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the Mudgala Purana was the last of the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha. She bases her reasoning on the fact that, among other internal evidence, the Mudgala Purana specifically mentions the Ganesha Purana as one of the four Puranas (the Brahma, the Brahmanda, the Ganesha, and the Mudgala Puranas) which deal at length with Ganesha.[203] While the kernel of the text must be old, it was interpolated until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions.[204] Another highly regarded scripture, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, was probably composed during the 16th or 17th centuries.[205] Ganesha Sahasranama is part of the Puranic literature, and is a litany of a thousand names and attributes of Ganesha. Each name in the sahasranama conveys a different meaning and symbolises a different aspect of Ganesha. Versions of the Ganesha Sahasranama are found in the Ganesha Purana.[206] One of the most important Sanskrit texts, that enjoys authority in Ganapatya tradition states John Grimes, is the Ganapati Atharvashirsa.[207] Beyond India and Hinduism[edit] ""Dancing Ganesh. Central Tibet. Early fifteenth century. Colours on cotton. Height: 68 centimeters"".[208] This form is also known as Maharakta (""The Great Red One"").[209] Commercial and cultural contacts extended India's influence in Western and Southeast Asia. Ganesha is one of a number of Hindu deities who consequently reached foreign lands.[210] Ganesha was particularly worshipped by traders and merchants, who went out of India for commercial ventures.[211] From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders.[212] The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity is associated with the merchant community.[213] Hindus migrated to Maritime Southeast Asia and took their culture, including Ganesha, with them.[214] Statues of Ganesha are found throughout the region, often beside Shiva sanctuaries. The forms of Ganesha found in the Hindu art of Java, Bali, and Borneo show specific regional influences.[215] The spread of Hindu culture throughout Southeast Asia established Ganesha worship in modified forms in Burma, Cambodia, and Thailand. In Indochina, Hinduism and Buddhism were practiced side by side, and mutual influences can be seen in the iconography of Ganesha in the region.[216] In Thailand, Cambodia, and among the Hindu classes of the Chams in Vietnam, Ganesha was mainly thought of as a remover of obstacles.[217] Today in Buddhist Thailand, Ganesha is regarded as a remover of obstacles, the god of success.[217] The Japanese form of Ganesha - Kangiten, late 18th-early 19th-century painting by Shorokuan Ekicho Before the arrival of Islam, Afghanistan had close cultural ties with India, and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practiced. Examples of sculptures from the 5th to the 7th centuries have survived, suggesting that the worship of Ganesha was then in vogue in the region.[218] Ganesha appears in Mahayana Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god Vinyaka, but also as a Hindu demon form with the same name.[219] His image appears in Buddhist sculptures during the late Gupta period.[220] As the Buddhist god Vinyaka, he is often shown dancing. This form, called Ntta Ganapati, was popular in northern India, later adopted in Nepal, and then in Tibet.[221] In Nepal, the Hindu form of Ganesha, known as Heramba, is popular; he has five heads and rides a lion.[222] Tibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent views of him.[223] A Tibetan rendering of Ganapati is tshogs bdag.[224] In one Tibetan form, he is shown being trodden under foot by Mahkla,(Shiva) a popular Tibetan deity.[225] Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles, and sometimes dancing.[226] Ganesha appears in China and Japan in forms that show distinct regional character. In northern China, the earliest known stone statue of Ganesha carries an inscription dated to 531.[227] In Japan, where Ganesha is known as Kangiten, the Ganesha cult was first mentioned in 806.[228] The canonical literature of Jainism does not mention the worship of Ganesha.[229] However, Ganesha is worshipped by most Jains, for whom he appears to have taken over certain functions of the god of wealth, Kubera.[230] Jain ties with the trading community support the idea that Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections.[231] The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century.[232] A 15th-century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of Ganapati images.[229] Images of Ganesha appear in the Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.[233] ^ Heras 1972, p. 58. ^ a b Getty 1936, p. 5. ^ ""Ganesha getting ready to throw his lotus.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(film_series),"Mission: Impossible is a series of action spy films based on the television series of the same name, produced by and starring Tom Cruise as an agent of the fictional Impossible Missions Force (IMF), Ethan Hunt. Beginning in 1996, the films follow the missions of the IMF's main field team under the leadership of Hunt, who is forced to take over after the team is betrayed from within in the first film. The series focuses on Hunt as the lead character as opposed to the ensemble cast structure of the television series, although some characters, such as Luther Stickell (played by American actor Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (played by British actor Simon Pegg) have recurring roles in the films. The series is the 20th-highest-grossing film series of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $2.7 billion to date.[2] A sixth film, titled Mission: Impossible – Fallout is set to be released in July 2018. Mission: Impossible (1996)[edit] Ethan Hunt is framed for the murder of his fellow IMF agents during a Prague Embassy mission gone wrong and falsely accused of selling government secrets to a mysterious international criminal known only as ""Max"". The action spy film was directed by Brian De Palma, and was produced by and starred Tom Cruise. Work on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script. De Palma came up with some action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events. U2 band members Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton produced an electronic dance version of the original theme song. The song went into top ten of music charts around the world, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The film was the third-highest-grossing of the year and received positive reviews from film critics. Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)[edit] Ethan sends international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) undercover to stop rogue IMF agent, and Nyah's former lover, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from stealing a deadly virus to start a pandemic and sell the antidote to the highest bidder. The film was directed by John Woo. Mission: Impossible III (2006)[edit] Ethan, retired from being an IMF team leader and engaged to be married, assembles a team to face the elusive arms and information broker Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who intends to sell a mysterious dangerous object known as ""The Rabbit's Foot"". The film was directed by J.J. Abrams. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)[edit] Ethan and the entire IMF are blamed for the bombing of the Kremlin while investigating an individual known only as ""Cobalt"" (Michael Nyqvist). He and three other agents are left to stop him from starting a global nuclear war. The film was directed by Brad Bird. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)[edit] Ethan Hunt comes under threat from the Syndicate, a near-mythical organization of rogue agents who kill to order. Faced with the IMF's disbandment, Hunt assembles his team for their mission to prove the Syndicate's existence and bring the organization down by any means necessary. The film was directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018)[edit] When an IMF mission ends badly, the world is faced with dire consequences. As Ethan Hunt takes it upon himself to fulfill his original briefing, the CIA begins to question his loyalty and his motives. Hunt finds himself in a race against time, hunted by assassins and former allies while trying to prevent a global catastrophe. The film was directed by Christopher McQuarrie.

Critical and public response[edit] Controversy[edit] Some fans of the TV series were upset that Jim Phelps, team leader in the series, became a traitor in the first movie, selling the details of government agents to an arms dealer. Actor Greg Morris, who portrayed Barney Collier in the original television series, was so disgusted with the film's treatment of the Phelps character that he walked out of the theater before the film ended.[21] Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the original series, was equally negative concerning the films. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated: ""When they were working on an early incarnation of the first one – not the script they ultimately did – they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that"", he said. ""It was basically an action-adventure movie and not 'Mission.' 'Mission' was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it. The script wasn't that good either.""[22] Peter Graves turned down an offer to portray Jim Phelps in the 1996 film because of Phelps being an antagonist.[23] Change to theme song[edit] The television version is in a rarely used 5/4 (five quarter-notes to a measure) time and is difficult to dance to,[24] as was proven by a memorable segment of American Bandstand in which teenage dancers were caught off-guard by Dick Clark's playing of the Lalo Schifrin single release. The opening theme music for the first three films are stylized renditions of Schifrin's original iconic theme, preserving the 5/4 rhythm, by Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, and Michael Giacchino respectively by the films' chronology. Most of the versions included in the score also retained the 5/4 time signature.[24] However, for Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr.'s remix featured on the first film's motion picture soundtrack, the time signature was changed to standard pop 4/4 (four quarter-notes to a measure) time to make it more dance-friendly, although the intro is still in 5/4 time.[24] Also, the Limp Bizkit song ""Take a Look Around"" from the soundtrack to the second film was set to a similar 4/4 modification of the theme, with an interlude in 5/4.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(film),"Mission: Impossible is a 1996 American action spy film directed by Brian De Palma, produced by and starring Tom Cruise. Based on the television series of the same name, the plot follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his mission to uncover the mole who has framed him for the murders of his entire Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team. Work on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script: De Palma devised several action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events. U2 band members Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton produced an electronic dance version of the original theme music. The tune went into the top-ten lists of music charts around the world and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The film was a commercial success, eventually becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1996, and received a mixed-to-favourable response from critics. The film's success spawned the Mission: Impossible film series. Years after the events of the series, Jim Phelps and his team, the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), attempt to retrieve the CIA non-official cover (NOC) list from the American embassy in Prague. Their mission fails: Phelps is shot, his wife Claire dies in a car bombing, and the rest of the team except Ethan Hunt are eliminated by unknown assassins. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the job was a setup to lure out a mole within IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as ""Max"" as part of ""Job 314."" As Hunt is the only member left, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees. Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes ""Job 314"" refers to Bible verse Job 3:14, ""Job"" being the mole's code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining she escaped the bomb after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that the list she possesses has a tracking device. He promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job's identity. Hunt, Max, and her agents escape just as a CIA team arrives. Hunt recruits two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, steal the real list, and flee to London. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from Liverpool Street Station. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt realizes Phelps is the mole, having discovered that Phelps stole a Gideons Bible from a Chicago hotel. He also suspects Krieger as the one who killed the other IMF members on the Prague job, but is unsure whether Claire was involved. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the TGV train to Paris the next day. On the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and gives Hunt the code to a briefcase containing the payment along with Job in the baggage car. Ethan calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Ethan will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Ethan, since they will need a fall guy for the money, when Phelps reveals himself to be Ethan in disguise, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole. Phelps threatens to kill Ethan, but shoots Claire instead when she intervenes. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents, but Hunt is unsure if he'll accept. As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is ready to take on a new mission, just as she asked Phelps at the beginning. Production[edit] Development and writing[edit] Paramount Pictures owned the rights to the television series and had tried for years to make a film version but had failed to come up with a viable treatment. Tom Cruise had been a fan of the show since he was young and thought that it would be a good idea for a film.[4] The actor chose Mission: Impossible to be the first project of his new production company and convinced Paramount to put up a $70 million budget.[5] Cruise and his producing partner, Paula Wagner, worked on a story with filmmaker Sydney Pollack for a few months when the actor hired Brian De Palma to direct.[6] They went through two screenplay drafts that no one liked. De Palma brought in screenwriters Steve Zaillian, David Koepp, and finally Robert Towne. According to the director, the goal of the script was to ""constantly surprise the audience.""[6] Reportedly, Koepp was paid $1 million to rewrite an original script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. According to one project source, there were problems with dialogue and story development. However, the basic plot remained intact.[7] The film went into pre-production without a script that the filmmakers wanted to use.[6] De Palma designed the action sequences but neither Koepp nor Towne were satisfied with the story that would make these sequences take place. Towne ended up helping organize a beginning, middle and end to hang story details on while De Palma and Koepp worked on the plot.[6] De Palma convinced Cruise to set the first act of the film in Prague, a city rarely seen in Hollywood films at the time.[5] Reportedly, studio executives wanted to keep the film's budget in the $40–50 million range, but Cruise wanted a ""big, showy action piece"" that took the budget up to the $62 million range.[7] The scene that takes place in a glass-walled restaurant with a big lobster tank in the middle and three huge fish tanks overhead was Cruise's idea.[5] There were 16 tons in all of the tanks and there was a concern that when they detonated, a lot of glass would fly around. De Palma tried the sequence with a stuntman, but it did not look convincing and he asked Cruise to do it, despite the possibility that the actor could have drowned.[5] The script that Cruise approved called for a final showdown to take place on top of a moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the TGV[5] but rail authorities did not want any part of the stunt performed on their trains.[6] When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission.[6] Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it.[5] For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity that would look visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face.[5] Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the Glasgow South Western Line, between New Cumnock, Dumfries and Annan. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at Industrial Light & Magic.[8] The filmmakers delivered the film on time and under budget with Cruise doing most of his own stunts.[4] Initially, there was a sophisticated opening sequence that introduced a love triangle between Phelps, his wife and Ethan Hunt that was removed because it took the test audience ""out of the genre"", according to De Palma.[6] There were rumors that the actor and De Palma did not get along and they were fueled by the director excusing himself at the last moment from scheduled media interviews before the film's theatrical release.[4] The film uses Lalo Schifrin's original ""Theme from Mission: Impossible"". However, originally Alan Silvestri was hired to write the film score and had, in fact, recorded somewhere around 23 minutes of the score.[citation needed] During post-production, due to creative differences, Silvestri's music was rejected and replaced with new music by composer Danny Elfman.[citation needed] According to some sources, the decision to replace Silvestri was made by producer Tom Cruise.[9] U2 bandmates Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton were fans of the TV show and knew the original theme music well, but were nervous about remaking Schifrin's legendary theme song.[10] Clayton put together his own version in New York City and Mullen did his in Dublin on weekends between U2 recording sessions. The two musicians were influenced by Brian Eno and the European dance club scene sound of the recently finished album Passengers. They allowed Polygram to pick its favorite and they wanted both. In a month, they had two versions of the song and five remixed by DJs. All seven tracks appeared on a limited edition vinyl release.[10] The song entered the top 10 of music charts around the world, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997, and was a critical and commercial success.[citation needed] Marketing[edit] Apple Computer had a $15 million promotion linked to the film that included a game, print ads and television spot featuring scenes from the TV show turned into the feature film; dealer and in-theater promos; and a placement of Apple personal computers in the film. This was an attempt on Apple's part to improve their image after posting a $740 million loss in its fiscal second quarter.[11] Reception[edit] Original television series cast[edit] Several cast members of the original 1966–73 TV series reacted negatively to the film. Actor Greg Morris, who portrayed Barney Collier in the original television series, was reportedly disgusted with the film's treatment of the Phelps character, and he walked out of the theater before the film ended.[12] Peter Graves, who played Jim Phelps in the original series as well as in the late-1980s revival, also disliked how Phelps turned out in the film.[13] Graves had been asked to reprise Phelps, but turned it down when he learned his character was going to be revealed to be a traitor. Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the original series, expressed his own disapproval concerning the film. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated, ""When they were working on an early incarnation of the first one — not the script they ultimately did — they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that. It was basically an action-adventure movie and not Mission. Mission was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it ... The script wasn't that good either!""[14] Box office[edit] Mission: Impossible opened on May 22, 1996 in 3,012 theaters—the most ever up to that point—and broke the record for a film opening on Wednesday with US$11.8 million, beating the $11.7 million Terminator 2: Judgment Day made in 1991.[15] The film also set house records in several theaters around the United States.[16] Mission: Impossible grossed $75 million in its first six days, surpassing Jurassic Park, and took in more than $56 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, beating out The Flintstones.[17] Cruise deferred his usual $20 million fee for a significant percentage of the box office.[17] The film went on to make $180.9 million in North America and $276.7 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $457.6 million.[18] Critical response[edit] Mission: Impossible received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The film has a 62% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10, with the critical consensus reading, ""Full of special effects, Brian DePalma's update of Mission: Impossible has a lot of sweeping spectacle, but the plot is sometimes convoluted"".[19] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[20] Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, ""This is a movie that exists in the instant, and we must exist in the instant to enjoy it.""[21] In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden addressed the film's convoluted plot: ""If that story doesn't make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn't matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense.""[22] Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and said that it was ""stylish, brisk but lacking in human dimension despite an attractive cast, the glass is either half-empty or half-full here, though the concoction goes down with ease.""[23] However, Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, ""There are empty thrills, and some suspense. But throughout the film, we keep waiting for some trace of personality, some color in the dialogue, some hipness in the staging or in the characters' attitudes. And it's not there.""[24] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, ""What is not present in Mission: Impossible (which, aside from the title, sound-track quotations from the theme song and self-destructing assignment tapes, has little to do with the old TV show) is a plot that logically links all these events or characters with any discernible motives beyond surviving the crisis of the moment.""[25] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a ""B"" rating and said, ""The problem isn't that the plot is too complicated; it's that each detail is given the exact same nagging emphasis. Intriguing yet mechanistic, jammed with action yet as talky and dense as a physics seminar, the studiously labyrinthine Mission: Impossible grabs your attention without quite tickling your imagination.""[26] References[edit] ^ ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (PG)"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Hunt,"Ethan Matthew Hunt is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Mission: Impossible film series. He is portrayed by Tom Cruise and appeared in all five films. Cruise is set to reprise his role in the sixth film which will be released in 2018.[1] Appearances[edit] Mission: Impossible (1996)[edit] In the first film, Hunt acts as the IMF point man for an experienced field team, led by veteran Jim Phelps, with whom he is closely bonded. While attempting to recover stolen files containing information on all IMF's field agents during a mission in Prague, the entire team, barring Hunt, is supposedly killed and the files are stolen, leaving Hunt the only suspect as he learns that the mission was a set-up to expose a mole who had been selling secrets to a Czech arms dealer. Hunt decides to steal the genuine list himself, demanding that the genuine mole be present at the exchange. He sets up a rogue team of other disavowed agents, including computer expert Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Béart), Jim's wife and the only other apparent survivor of the mission. After recovering the list, Hunt is shocked to learn that the true traitor is actually Jim Phelps himself, who was completely unhinged and had become disillusioned with his career after feeling that he had become irrelevant. Phelps faked his own death in order to frame Hunt and was working with Krieger and Claire to eliminate the team's other members. Setting up a situation where Jim's continued survival and his criminal activity is exposed to the head of IMF, Hunt kills Jim and Krieger as they attempt to escape from the train where Hunt had arranged to make the exchange, with Claire being killed in the crossfire. At the conclusion of the film, Hunt meets briefly with Stickell and is taking over Jim's position. Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)[edit] The second film in the series was directed by action filmmaker John Woo in 2000. In the film, Hunt is tasked with retrieving a deadly genetically engineered virus, known as ""Chimera"", from a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who intends to release the virus after acquiring a controlling influence on the company that created it so that he can profit from sales of the cure. Hunt attempts to infiltrate Ambrose's inner circle through Ambrose's former girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), an accomplished thief. During their mission, Hunt and Nordoff-Hall engage in an affair that complicates the mission. At the climax, Nordoff-Hall is forced to infect herself with the last virus in order to save Hunt; with Hunt having destroyed the only other traces of the virus, she was thus able to shield Hunt until he could escape. Subsequently racing against time—the virus is incurable twenty hours after infection—Hunt manages to acquire the cure and kill Ambrose. Mission: Impossible III (2006)[edit] In the third film, Hunt is now a semi-retired training officer for IMF and plans a quiet life with his fiancée Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), who doesn't know about the IMF. He is called back into service to rescue a former student captured during a mission in Germany, and recovers confidential information via stolen laptop. He is forced to once again go rogue in an attempt to track down the sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and secure a dangerous mystery item known as the 'Rabbit's Foot'. After an impromptu ceremony, Hunt and Julia are married, only for Owen, who has a double agent working within IMF, to kidnap Julia. With the help of his IMF team (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Maggie Q), Hunt finds the Rabbit's foot, saves his wife, and kills Owen Davian in Shanghai. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)[edit] In the fourth film, Hunt—having just escaped from a deep-cover mission in prison—and his IMF team are blamed for an attack that destroys the Kremlin, resulting in the disavowal of the entire IMF. Despite lacking their usual resources, connections, technology, and backup, their mission is to find and stop Kurt Hendricks, a former Soviet nuclear strategist who is intent on starting a nuclear war to usher in the next era of human evolution. As they chase Hendricks to Dubai and on to India, they themselves are pursued by a team of Russian agents trying to apprehend them. The team becomes increasingly fractured as individual members fight their own demons while trying to trust the others. Hunt manages to pull the team together, stop a nuclear bomb and clear the IMF of any involvement in the Kremlin attack. It is also revealed that Hunt had Julia's death faked to protect her, something only he and the Secretary of IMF knew about, giving him the pretext to infiltrate the prison his team freed him from in the opening scenes. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)[edit] At the beginning of the fifth film, Hunt is assigned a mission that culminates in him hanging outside of an A400M military aircraft 5,000 feet above the ground in Belarus to recover a package that contains VX nerve gas. Although this mission succeeds, when he learns that the thieves responsible for stealing the gas lacked the connections to do so, Hunt begins to uncover evidence of the existence of the Syndicate, essentially an 'anti-IMF' with all of the organisation's training and skills but used for criminal purposes. After Hunt is forced to go off-the-grid when he is nearly killed by a Syndicate operative and the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA due to its controversial and destructive methods, he spends six months trying to track the Syndicate. Eventually, he and his former team learn that the Syndicate was actually originally a British project to perform missions without oversight, but British agent Solomon Lane took the plans and went rogue, now seeking to steal files that would grant him access to various established bank accounts to finance future Syndicate operations. Refusing to allow the Syndicate to continue, Hunt and his team are able to capture Lane, with CIA Director Alan Hunley subsequently forced to claim that the disbanding of IMF was a cover to allow them to track the Syndicate. Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018)[edit] Hunt will appear in the sixth film, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Video games[edit] Aside from the Mission: Impossible films, Ethan Hunt has appeared in the 1998 video game based on the first film and the 2003 video game Mission: Impossible – Operation Surma, voiced by Steve Blum. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover game Lego Dimensions, with archive footage from the first film being used for his voice. References[edit]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_2,"Mission: Impossible 2 (also stylized as Mission: Impossible II[1][4] and abbreviated as M:I-2[1]) is a 2000 American action spy film directed by John Woo and starring Tom Cruise, who also served as the film's producer. It is the second installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. In the film, Ethan Hunt is recruited by the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) to find and destroy a dangerous biological weapon called ""Chimera"" from a rogue IMF agent named Sean Ambrose with the help of his new girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Mission: Impossible 2 was released in theaters worldwide on May 24, 2000. It grossed more than $546.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film of 2000. Reviews were mixed to positive; praise was directed at Tom Cruise's performance and the action sequences, but the plot and dialogue were criticized. Ethan Hunt is alerted by the IMF that someone has used his identity to assist bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich to enter the United States, only to kill him in a subsequent plane crash. Nekhorvich, an old friend of Ethan, had forewarned the IMF of his arrival, planning to deliver to them a new bioweapon, Chimera, and its cure, Bellerophon. He was forced to develop these by Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. IMF determines that rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose is responsible. IMF assigns Ethan to recover the virus and its cure. It also insists that he recruits Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain. Later, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. After recruiting Nyah, Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to learn about the Chimera virus. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues. He then blackmails McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals video footage and transfers it to Ethan. Ethan's team learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. The IMF team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, they learn that the only samples of Bellerophon were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus (which Nekhorvich injected himself with). As a result, Ambrose forced McCloy to exchange a sample of the virus for a sample of Bellerophon. The team break into Biocyte to destroy the virus. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing his plan. Ambrose captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of the virus before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the last sample of Chimera. She injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her to get it. Ambrose takes Nyah away, and Ethan escapes from the laboratory. Ambrose lets Nyah wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him the majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent Chimera from spreading. Ethan eventually gains the upper hand over Ambrose and kills him. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan, takes Bellerophon and injects Nyah with it. IMF clears Nyah's criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney. Anthony Hopkins has an uncredited cameo role as Mission Commander Swanbeck.[5] Production[edit] According to screenwriter Robert Towne several action sequences were already planned for the film prior to his involvement and before the story had been written.[6] The studio expressed concern over the safety of shooting Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)'s entrance in the film, where he is free solo climbing in Moab, Utah's Dead Horse Point State Park.[7] Cruise refused to drop the idea because he could not think of a better way to reintroduce the character. There was no safety net as he filmed the sequence, but he did have a harness. He tore his shoulder when performing Hunt's jump from one part of the cliff to another.[8] Marketing[edit] The first trailer to the film was released in November 1999 and was later shown before Pokemon: The First Movie. The film's original score was composed by Hans Zimmer and features vocals performed by Lisa Gerrard.[9] In addition, the film includes contemporary music such as Limp Bizkit's rendition of Lalo Schifrin's Mission: Impossible theme entitled ""Take a Look Around"" as well as Metallica's ""I Disappear"".[10] While vacationer Ethan is rock climbing, Zap Mama's remixed version of ""Iko Iko"" plays on the soundtrack. Reception[edit] Box office[edit] In its North American opening weekend, the film grossed $57,845,297, ranking at #1. It held on to the No. 1 spot for three weekends. The film eventually grossed $215,409,889 in its North American release and $330,978,216 in other territories, totaling $546,388,105 worldwide, the highest-grossing film of 2000.[3] It was also John Woo's highest grossing film of all time. Critical response[edit] Mission: Impossible 2 received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising the fast-paced action scenes, Tom Cruise's performance and Hans Zimmer's musical score, but criticizing the plot, dialogue, little resemblance to its source material, and overall lack of substance. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes indicates the film was certified as ""Rotten"" with overall approval rating of 57% based on 143 reviews, with an average score of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Your cranium may crave more substance, but your eyes will feast on the amazing action sequences"".[11] Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[12] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said that ""if the first movie was entertaining as sound, fury, and movement, this one is more evolved, more confident, more sure-footed in the way it marries minimal character development to seamless action.""[4] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly felt the film was a ""throwaway pleasure"" but also ""a triumph of souped-up action.""[13] Ella Taylor of LA Weekly said that ""every car chase, every plane crash, every potential drop off a cliff is a masterpiece of grace and surprise.""[14] Desson Howe of The Washington Post said that ""[John] Woo [...] takes complete command of the latest technology to create brilliant action sequences.""[15] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, ""Check your brains at the popcorn stand and hang on for a spectacular ride.""[16] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice called the film ""a vaguely absurd thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs.""[17] Dennis Harvey of Variety said the film is ""even more empty a luxury vehicle than its predecessor"" and that it ""pushes the envelope in terms of just how much flashy packaging an audience will buy when there's absolutely nada inside.""[18] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader said that ""no hero or villain winds up carrying any moral weight at all.""[19] In a retrospective commentary in 2012, Brad Brevet noted the film has significant similarities in plot and themes to Alfred Hitchcock's 1946 film Notorious.[20] Mission: Impossible 2 was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards at the 2000 ceremony, including Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton.[21] A comedy short titled Mission: Improbable was shown during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. It is a mockumentary of the behind-the-scenes stunts of Mission: Impossible 2, and stars Cruise, Ben Stiller, and Woo. See also[edit] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f ""Mission: Impossible II (2000)"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_III,"Mission: Impossible III (stylized as M:i:III) is a 2006 American action spy film co-written and directed by J. J. Abrams in his directorial debut and starring Tom Cruise, who also served as a producer, in the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt. It is the third installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. In the film, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has retired from field work for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and trains new recruits. However, he is sent back into action to track down the elusive arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2006, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2006, by Paramount Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success.[3] A sequel, entitled Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, was released in December 2011. Ethan Hunt has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's true job. He is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell. The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp. IMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object called the ""Rabbit's Foot"". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian. On the flight back to the U.S., Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about Rabbit's foot, but Davian remains tightlipped. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel is attacked, and Davian escapes. Ethan races to Julia's workplace, only to find she has already been kidnapped. Davian gives Ethan 48 hours to recover the Rabbit's Foot in exchange for Julia's life, but Ethan is soon captured by the IMF. Musgrave takes part in Ethan's interrogation but discreetly mouths that the Rabbit's Foot is located in Shanghai, China, and provides Ethan with the means to escape. Ethan escapes IMF headquarters, travels to Shanghai, and acquires Rabbit's Foot along with his team. As he delivers Rabbit's Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, he realizes a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. The restrained Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit's Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves. Musgrave arrives and explains that the woman killed was not Julia, but Davian's head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of Rabbit's Foot. Julia is alive and held as hostage. Musgrave reveals himself as the mole. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit's Foot and sell to a terrorist group, so that IMF would have reasons to launch a preemptive strike. When Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan knocks him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave's phone to track the last call's location to find Julia. He arrives and finds the place, but encounters Davian. Davian triggers the micro-explosive in Ethan's head, but Ethan kills him and then jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Before electrocuting himself, he kisses Julia and teaches her how to use his Beretta 92 to defend herself. While Ethan is unconscious, Musgrave and a henchman arrive and Julia shoots them dead.

At that point, when you own a franchise like that, you want to get rid of any extraneous opinions."" —David Fincher, on contributing to a film series[4] In 2002, director David Fincher was slated to direct the next installment of the Mission: Impossible film series for a summer of 2004 release date.[5] Fincher, however, dropped out in favor of another film,[6] later citing creative differences over the direction of the series.[4] Replacing Fincher was director Joe Carnahan, who worked on developing the film for 15 months.[7] Under his involvement, the film was to feature ""Kenneth Branagh playing a guy who's based on Timothy McVeigh,"" as well as Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson in other roles.[8] Thandie Newton was offered to reprise her role as Nyah Nordoff-Hall from Mission: Impossible 2; she declined, however. After a dispute over the film's tone, Carnahan quit in July 2004.[6] Tom Cruise then called J. J. Abrams, offering the directorial role for the film after having binge-watched the first two seasons of Alias.[9] Abrams ultimately signed on, with production delayed a year due to his contractual obligations with Alias and Lost.[10] During this time, Branagh, Moss, and Johansson departed from the project because of the many delays in production.[6][11] On June 8, 2005, Paramount Pictures gave the film the green-light after a new cast of actors was hired and the film's budget was redeveloped, with Cruise taking a major pay cut.[11] Filming[edit] Principal photography began in Rome, Italy on July 18, 2005 and ended in October. Location filming took place in China (Shanghai and Xitang), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Rome and Caserta), the United States (California, Virginia and Maryland), and Vatican City. The night scenes involving the skyscrapers were filmed in Shanghai, while some of the Shanghai filming was also done in Los Angeles.[9] The film's musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino. He is the third composer to take on the series, following Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. The score album was released on May 9, 2006 by Varèse Sarabande Records. Unlike the previous installments, no soundtrack album featuring the film's contemporary music was released. Despite this, the film features a song by Kanye West entitled ""Impossible"" that also features Twista, Keyshia Cole and BJ.[12] Distribution[edit] Marketing[edit] To promote the film, Paramount rigged 4,500 randomly selected Los Angeles Times vending boxes with digital audio players which would play the theme song when the door was opened. The audio players did not always stay concealed, and in many cases came loose and fell on top of the stack of newspapers in plain view, with the result that they were widely mistaken for bombs. Police bomb squads detonated a number of the vending boxes and even temporarily shut down a veterans hospital in response to the apparent ""threat"". Despite these problems, Paramount and the Los Angeles Times opted to leave the audio players in the boxes until two days after the movie's opening.[13] ""Trapped in the Closet"" controversy[edit] A blog entry of Hollywoodinterrupted.com in March 2006 alleged that Viacom (parent of Paramount and Comedy Central) canceled the rebroadcast of the South Park episode ""Trapped in the Closet"" due to threats by Cruise to refuse to participate in the Mission: Impossible III publicity circle.[14][15] These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and American Morning.[15][16] Fox News attributed threats from Cruise, stating, ""to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn't pull a repeat of the episode"", as evidence of ""bad blood"" between Cruise and Viacom.[17] The Washington Post reported that South Park fans ""struck back"", in March 2006, and threatened to boycott Mission: Impossible III until Comedy Central put ""Trapped in the Closet"" back on its schedule.[18] Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the film's box office debut.[19] Political blogger Andrew Sullivan encouraged a boycott of the film, based on claims that Cruise allegedly forced Comedy Central to censor a South Park episode about Scientologists. ""Make sure you don't go see Paramount's Mission: Impossible III, Cruise's upcoming movie,"" Sullivan wrote. ""I know you weren't going to see it anyway. But now any money you spend on this movie is a blow against freedom of speech. Boycott it. Tell your friends to boycott it.""[20] When asked in ABC's Primetime about his involvement with stopping the episode rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated ""First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'""[21] A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue, specifically responding to allegations of Cruise's reputed corporate power play.[22] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Opening in 4,054 theaters all across the United States,[23] the fourth largest opening ever up to that point,[24] the film topped the box office in its opening weekend. It made $16.6 million on its opening day and $47.7 million in its opening weekend,[23] a solid opening yet almost $10 million lower than the franchise's previous films.[25] The film remained at number one with $25 million during its second weekend, ahead of Poseidon's gross of $22.2 million.[23] The film remained in the Top 10 at the box office for the remainder of its first six weeks.[23] It ended its initial domestic run on July 20, 2006, taking in a total of $134 million.[23] It was the second movie in 2006 to pass the $100,000,000 mark in the box office, following Ice Age: The Meltdown.[citation needed] The $134 million domestic run was significantly lower than that of Mission Impossible II,[23] as well as box office analysts' expectations.[who?][citation needed] Outside the US, the film grossed $70 million during its first five days (in some Asian countries, it opened two days ahead of its North American release date) and was easily the box-office champion in many countries.[23] As of 2017, its international box office gross has reached $263.8 million for a combined worldwide gross of $397.9 million, the lowest so far of the series.[23] In the Netherlands, the film debuted at No. 1 in the week of May 4–10, grossing a total of € 532,384. The following week, the film remained on the top position. In its third, the film dropped to No. 2 and fell to No. 4 to the following week. Next, it maintained the No. 4 position to drop to No. 6 (in the week of June 6 - June 14). In total, the film has grossed over € 2,141,162.[26] Critical response[edit] On the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible III received 70% positive reviews from critics, with an average of 6.6, based on 220 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Fast-paced, with eye-popping stunts and special effects, the latest Mission: Impossible installment delivers everything an action fan could ask for. A thrilling summer popcorn flick.""[27] It holds a similar rating on Metacritic, with an average score of 66/100, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"" based on a normalized average of 42 reviews.[3] On the television show Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper gave Mission: Impossible III a ""thumbs up,"" while Roger Ebert gave it a marginal ""thumbs down.""[28] In Ebert's print review, he gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Either you want to see mindless action and computer-generated sequences executed with breakneck speed and technical precision, or you do not. I am getting to the point where I don't much care."" He felt ""surprised that the plot hangs together more than in the other two films.""[29] Keith Phipps of The Onion's A.V. Club said the film is ""business as usual, but it's the best kind of business as usual, and it finds everyone working in top form.""[30] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Mission: Impossible III ""a gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence.""[31] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle said that ""it's all poppycock, of course, but it's done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot.""[32] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying that it ""provides lots of action, but too little excitement.""[33] Ian Nathan of Empire said that Mission: Impossible III has ""an inspired middle-hour pumped by some solid action"" but added that ""we now live in a post-Bourne, recalibrated-Bond universe, where Ethan Hunt looks a bit lost.""[34] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that ""Hoffman enlivens Mission: Impossible III"" but criticized the film's ""maudlin romance"" and ""Abrams's inability to adapt his small-screen talent to a larger canvas.""[35] Rob Nelson of the Dallas Observer said that ""Abrams's movie is too oppressive, too enamored of its brutality to deliver anything like real thrills; its deeply unpleasant tone nearly makes you long even for [Mission: Impossible 2 director John] Woo's cartoon absurdities.""[36] Claudia Puig of USA Today said that ""Mission: Impossible III delivers"" despite ""a sense that the franchise is played out and its star over-exposed.""[37] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide described the film as ""breezy, undemanding, and a carefully balanced blend of the familiar and the not-quite-what-you-expected.""[38] Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer said that Mission: Impossible III is ""plenty of fun"" despite being ""overwrought and overplotted.""[39] Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat said that ""you may be mildly entertained, but damned if you'll remember any of it five minutes later.""[40] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com said that ""Cruise is the single bright, blinking emblem of the failure of Mission: Impossible III.""[41] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked that ""the latest [Mission: Impossible film] is just this side of insultingly stupid.""[42] Shawn Levy of The Oregonian said that Mission: Impossible III ""feels like one of the more forgettable James Bond films—saddled, moreover, with a star who's sliding into self-parody.""[43] References[edit] ^ ""MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III (12A)"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Ghost_Protocol,"Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is a 2011 American action spy film directed by Brad Bird and written by Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec. It is the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and also Bird's first live-action film.[4] It stars Tom Cruise, who reprises his role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt, alongside Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, Michael Nyqvist, Anil Kapoor, and Léa Seydoux. Ghost Protocol was produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams (the third film's director) and Bryan Burk. It saw the return of editor Paul Hirsch and visual effects supervisor John Knoll from the first film, and is also the first Mission: Impossible film to be partially filmed using IMAX cameras. Released in North America by Paramount Pictures on December 16, 2011, the film was a critical and commercial success. Ghost Protocol became the highest-grossing film in the series with $694 million,[5] and the highest-grossing film starring Cruise.[6][7][8] A sequel, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, was released in July 2015. IMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in Budapest by assassin Sabine Moreau, who takes the file containing Russian nuclear launch codes he had stolen so she can give them to a man known only as ""Cobalt"". Meanwhile, IMF agent Ethan Hunt has purposely become incarcerated into a Moscow prison to acquire Bogdan, a source of information on Cobalt. With help of Jane Carter, Hanaway's handler, and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn, Hunt and Bogdan make their escape. IMF tasks Hunt to infiltrate the Kremlin to gain more information on Cobalt. During the mission, an unknown entity broadcasts on the IMF frequency ordering the detonation of a bomb. Hunt's team aborts the mission just as a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Carter and Dunn escape, but Hunt is captured by SVR agent Anatoly Sidorov and charged with the destruction of the Kremlin. Hunt is able to escape and regroups with the IMF Secretary who is in Moscow on other business. The Secretary tells Hunt they have had to initiate ""Ghost Protocol"", disavowing IMF, but secretly orders Hunt to continue to pursue Cobalt. Sidorov's forces catch up to Hunt, and the Secretary is killed; Hunt escapes along with the Secretary's aide and intelligence analyst William Brandt. Regrouping with Carter and Dunn, Brandt is able to identify Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist, who seeks to start a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. Hendricks used the Kremlin bombing to cover up his theft of a Russian nuclear launch-control device, and now is planning a trade with Moreau at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai to gain the required launch codes. The team travel to Dubai and create deceptions using their various gadgetry and disguises to make Moreau believe she is meeting with Hendricks, and vice versa, when in fact they are interacting with the IMF team. Moreau discovers the deception, and in the ensuing chaos, Hendricks manages to escape with the launch codes, losing Hunt's pursuit in the midst of a dust storm. Carter knocks Moreau out of a window when she tries to escape. Brandt accuses her of letting her love for Hanaway compromise the mission, but Hunt recognizes that Brandt has also been keeping secrets from them, having shown combat skills atypical of a mere analyst. Hunt leaves to meet with Bogdan to get more information on Hendricks, while Brandt tells the others that he had been assigned to secretly protect Ethan and his wife Julia in Croatia. Julia had been killed by a hit squad and Brandt feels responsible for Ethan's loss, which is why he stopped being a field agent. Bogdan directs Ethan towards Mumbai, where Hendricks is set to negotiate with Indian telecommunications entrepreneur Brij Nath to gain control of an obsolete Soviet military satellite. The IMF team splits up to stop Hendricks; Carter seduces Nath to get the satellite override code, while Hunt, Brandt and Dunn try to stop Hendricks from using Nath's broadcast station. They are too late as Hendricks has sent the launch codes to a Russian Delta III-class nuclear submarine to fire a single missile at San Francisco and disabled the station's computer systems. Brandt and Dunn race to get the systems back online to send the override code, while Hunt pursues Hendricks, eventually fighting him face to face in an automated car park. Hendricks, with the launch device, jumps to his death moments before the missile is to land. Hunt takes a dangerous fall to use the device to disable the missile before it strikes. Sidorov, who has followed IMF from Dubai to Mumbai, arrives and realizes that the IMF is innocent of the Kremlin bombing. The team meets in Seattle after Ethan accepts a new mission from Luther Stickell. Brandt confesses to Ethan about his failure to protect Julia. Ethan, however, reveals that her ""death"" and the murder of the Serbians were part of a plot to give her a new identity and enable Ethan to infiltrate the prison. A relieved Brandt accepts his mission. Ethan and Julia gaze at each other from afar before Ethan departs for his next mission. Production[edit] Despite Mission: Impossible III earning less than its predecessors at the box office, Paramount Pictures was keen on developing a fourth film.[12] In August 2009, Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec were hired to write the film's screenplay.[13] Because of other commitments, J. J. Abrams said that it was unlikely for him to return as director but made note that he will produce the film alongside Tom Cruise.[14] By March 2010, director Brad Bird was in talks of directing the film with Cruise officially returning to star as Ethan Hunt.[15] The film was originally announced with a working name of Mission: Impossible 4 and code-named ""Aries"" during early production.[16] By August 2010, title considerations did not include the Mission: Impossible 4 name, and thought was given to omitting the specific term ""Mission: Impossible"", which Variety compared to Christopher Nolan's Batman sequel film The Dark Knight.[17] In late October 2010, however, the title was confirmed as Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.[18] Christopher McQuarrie (who later directed Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout) did an uncredited rewrite of the screenplay, explaining that: On Ghost Protocol I came in on the middle of the shoot to do a rewrite of the screenplay, though they had already started the movie. I had to communicate with the entire staff to determine what I could and couldn’t change, what sets had been built or struck, what scenes I could or couldn’t reshoot. I learned so much about production being right there. ...The script had these fantastic sequences in it but there was a mystery in it that was very complicated. What I did was about clarity. The mystery had to be made simpler. It’s like reaching into a sock and pulling it inside out. It’s still a sock, still all the same pieces, but all put together in a different order.[19] Filming[edit] The film was partially shot with IMAX cameras, which made up approximately 30 minutes of the film's run time.[20][21] Bird insisted that certain scenes of the film be shot in IMAX, as opposed to 3D, as he felt that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion due to its brighter, higher quality image, which is projected on a larger screen, without the need for specialised glasses.[22] Bird also believed that the IMAX format would bring back ""a level of showmanship"" to the presentation of Hollywood films, which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in multiplexes as opposed to grand theaters, and vetoing ""first runs"" in favor of wider initial releases.[22] ""When we were first looking at the image of Tom climbing the Burj, in the long shots we could not only see the traffic in the reflections when he presses down on the glass... But you actually saw the glass warp slightly because of the pressure of his hand. You would never see that in 35mm. The fact that the screen fills your vision and is super sharp seems more life-like."" —Brad Bird describing the advantages of filming in the IMAX format.[23] Principal photography took place from October 2010 to March 2011.[24] Filming took place in Mumbai, Prague, Moscow, Vancouver, Bangalore, and Dubai.[25][26][27] Tom Cruise performed a sequence where Ethan Hunt scales the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower, which is the world's tallest building, without the use of a stunt double.[28] Although Cruise appears to be free solo climbing in the film with the help of special gloves, in reality, he was securely attached to the Burj Khalifa at all times by multiple cables.[24] Industrial Light & Magic digitally erased the cables in post-production. Following Cruise's example, Patton and Seydoux also chose to forgo the use of stunt doubles for their fight scene at the Burj Khalifa where Carter exacts her revenge upon Moreau for Hanaway's death.[24] Many of the film's interior scenes were shot at Vancouver's Canadian Motion Picture Park Studios, including a key transition scene in a specially equipped IMF train car and the fight between Hunt and Hendricks in a Mumbai automated multi-level parking garage (which was constructed over a six-month period just for the film).[24] The film's climax scene was shot with Indian film actor Anil Kapoor in the Sun Network office in Bangalore.[29][30] Also, the film's opening Moscow prison escape scenes were shot on location in a real former prison near Prague.[24] Bird, having directed several Disney and Pixar films and short films, incorporated the trademark ""A113"" into the film on two separate occasions. The first is the design print on Hanaway's ring during the flashback sequence, and the second being when Hunt calls in for support and uses the drop callsign, Alpha 1-1-3.[31] Soundtrack[edit] The musical score for Ghost Protocol was composed by Michael Giacchino, who also composed the music for the third film and collaborated with Bird on The Incredibles and Ratatouille. As in previous installments, the score incorporates Lalo Schifrin's themes from the original television series.[32] ""Lalo is an amazing jazz writer. You know you can't write a straight-up jazz score for a film like this but you can certainly hint at it here and there,"" said Giacchino, explaining the stylistic influence generated by Schifrin's history with the franchise.[33] A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande on January 10, 2012.[34] All music composed by Michael Giacchino.

One of the many scenes that were included was a chase scene in a Dubai desert sandstorm.[36] During November 2011, the Paramount released a Facebook game of the film in order to promote it. The new game allowed players to choose the roles of IMF agents and assemble teams to embark on a multiplayer journey. Players were also able to garner tickets to the film's U.S. premiere and a hometown screening of the film for 30 friends.[37] Theatrical release[edit] Following the world premiere in Dubai on December 7, 2011,[38] the film was released in IMAX and other large-format theaters in the U.S. on December 16, 2011,[39] with general release on December 21, 2011. Home media[edit] Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download on April 17, 2012.[40] The home media releases, however, do not preserve the original IMAX imagery,[41][42] and its aspect ratio is consistently cropped to 2.40:1 rather than switching to a 1.78:1 aspect ratio during the IMAX scenes. Blu-ray Disc releases such as The Dark Knight,[43] Tron: Legacy,[44] and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen[45] will switch between 2.40:1 for regular scenes and 1.78:1 for IMAX scenes. Reception[edit] Critical response[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 233 reviews and an average rating of 7.7/10, making it the best-reviewed entry of the series. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Stylish, fast-paced, and loaded with gripping set pieces, the fourth Mission: Impossible is big-budget popcorn entertainment that really works.""[46] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[47] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of four stars, saying the film ""is a terrific thriller with action sequences that function as a kind of action poetry"".[48] Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger wrote ""The eye-candy—from high-tech gadgets to gorgeous people—has only been ratcheted up. And so has the excitement."" He also gave the film 3.5 out of four stars.[49] Giving the film three out of four stars, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said ""In its way, the movie has old-Hollywood elegance. The scope and sets are vast, tall, and cavernous, but Bird scales down for spatial intimacy.""[50] Philippa Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the film three stars out of five and said it is ""ludicrously improbable, but also quite fun.""[51] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly opined that the movie ""brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time; they're brought off with such casual aplomb that they're funny, too. ... Ghost Protocol is fast and explosive, but it's also a supremely clever sleight-of-hand thriller. Brad Bird, the animation wizard, ... showing an animator's miraculously precise use of visual space, has a playful, screw-tightening ingenuity all his own.""[52] Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer said ""Brad Bird passes his audition for a career as a live-action director. And Ghost Protocol more than makes its bones as an argument for why Tom Cruise should continue in this role as long as his knees, and his nerves, hold up."" He gave the film three out of four stars.[53] Box office[edit] Ghost Protocol grossed $209,397,903 in North America and $485,315,477 in other countries for a worldwide total of $694,713,380.[54] It is the highest-grossing film worldwide in the Mission: Impossible series,[55] and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2011.[56] It is also the highest-grossing film worldwide starring Cruise, surpassing War of the Worlds from the top spot.[57] In limited release at 425 locations in North America, it earned $12.8 million over its opening weekend.[58] After five days of limited release, it expanded to 3,448 theaters on its sixth day and reached #1 at the box office with $8.92 million.[59] The film reached the top stop at the box office in its second and third weekends with $29.6 million and $29.4 million respectively.[60][61] Though only 9% of the film's screenings were in IMAX theaters, they accounted for 23% of the film's box office.[62] Outside North America, it debuted to a $69.5 million in 42 markets representing approximately 70% of the marketplace. In the United Arab Emirates, it set an opening-weekend record of $2.4 million (since surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers).[63] In two countries outside the U.S. in which filming took place, its opening weekend gross increased by multiples over the previous installment: in Russia, more than doubling, to $6.08 million[64] and in India, more than quadrupling, to $4.0 million.[65] It is the second highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film outside North America.[66] It topped the box office outside North America for three consecutive weekends (during December 2011)[67] and five weekends in total (the other two in 2012).[57] Its highest-grossing markets after North America are China ($102.5 million),[68] Japan ($69.7 million), and South Korea ($51.1 million).[69] Accolades[edit] In December 2011, Pegg suggested that he and Cruise were interested in returning for a fifth Mission: Impossible film.[76] Paramount was also reportedly interested in fast-tracking a fifth film due to the fourth film's success.[77] Bird had stated that he probably would not return to direct a fifth film, but Tom Cruise had been confirmed to return.[78] It was revealed In August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would be the director of Mission: Impossible 5.[79] Principal photography began in February 2014 in London.[80] Paramount Pictures released the film on July 31, 2015.[81] The plot centers around Hunt's IMF team in conflict with ""the Syndicate"", an international criminal organization first mentioned at the end of Ghost Protocol.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Rogue_Nation,"Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris, Ving Rhames, Simon McBurney and Tom Hollander, with Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames reprising their roles from previous films. Rogue Nation is produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, and David Ellison of Skydance Productions. In the film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is on the run from the CIA, following the IMF's disbandment as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a mysterious international terrorist consortium. Filming began on August 21, 2014, in Vienna, Austria, and concluded on March 12, 2015. The film was released in North America by Paramount Pictures on July 31, 2015. In its opening weekend it took in $55.5 million at the U.S. box office[4] and went on to gross $195 million in North America and $682 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the series, as well as the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2015. A sequel, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, is scheduled for release on July 27, 2018 with Simon Pegg returning as Benji Dunn and McQuarrie also returning as writer and director. After intercepting nerve gas being sold to Chechen terrorists in Minsk, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is determined to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a criminal consortium the CIA does not believe exists. Hunt is captured by the Syndicate at a record shop in London, while their leader, a blond man in glasses, kills the IMF agent stationed there. Hunt escapes a torture chamber led by Syndicate member Janik ""Bone Doctor"" Vinter with the help of disavowed MI6 agent and Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust. In Washington, D.C., CIA Director Alan Hunley and IMF Field Operations Director William Brandt testify before a Senate committee. The IMF, currently without a secretary in charge, is controversial because of its destructive methods and various misconducts. Hunley succeeds in having the IMF disbanded and absorbed into the CIA. Brandt, knowing Hunley will try to capture Hunt, warns him to stay undercover. Cut off from the IMF, Hunt follows his only lead: the man in glasses, later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane. Six months later, Hunt, still a fugitive living in Paris (luring a CIA team to a decoy safe house in Havana), enlists former colleague Benji Dunn to attend an opera in Vienna, predicting that an assassination attempt will be made on the Austrian Chancellor at the performance, and that Lane will also be there. The two stop three snipers, including Faust, but the Chancellor is killed by a car bomb, and Lane is still not found. Faust drops hints of Lane's plan to Hunt before leaving. Dunn stays with Hunt instead of reporting back to the CIA, despite knowing his action amounts to treason. Hunt, blamed for the Chancellor's death, is pursued by the CIA's Special Activities Division. Brandt contacts Luther Stickell to find Hunt before the CIA does. Stickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to Casablanca, where they acquire a secret file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data, evading both Hunt and Syndicate members, although Hunt kills the pursuing agents. Dunn reveals he copied the data onto a second USB drive, as Stickell and Brandt catch up to them. Faust returns to London and attempts to use the file to quit her mission to infiltrate the Syndicate, but her MI6 handler, Atlee, compels her to continue, whilst discreetly wiping her drive. Meanwhile, Ethan learns that the data is an encrypted British government red box that requires the Prime Minister's biometrics to unlock it. Lane's men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to blackmail Hunt into decrypting the data and delivering it to them. Hunt agrees to the ultimatum, despite protests from Brandt. As part of Hunt's plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. At a London charity auction, Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee take the PM to a secure room to protect him from Hunt. Brandt has the PM confirm the existence of the Syndicate, a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, effectively making the PM ""judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability"", before Atlee reveals himself as Hunt in a mask. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission, and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6. With the PM's biometrics, Stickell discovers the file contains access to 2.4 billion British pounds in various bank accounts, which would allow the Syndicate to continue their operations unnoticed; Hunt promptly destroys the data. At the meeting, outside the Tower of London, he tells Lane he memorized the data, and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Ethan and Faust are chased through the streets of London by Lane's men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Ethan confronts Lane and lures him into a sealed, bulletproof glass cell where he is gassed unconscious and taken into custody. Hunley, having witnessed an IMF operation's success firsthand, returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and convinces them to restore the IMF by covering for Hunt and his team. After the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, an IMF Field Operations Director Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent undercover in the Syndicate Alec Baldwin as Alan Hunley, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Sean Harris as Solomon Lane, a former MI6 agent who went rogue and became the supreme leader of the Syndicate Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent and computer specialist Simon McBurney as Atlee, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service Tom Hollander as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Zhang Jingchu as Lauren, a CIA analyst Jens Hultén as Janik Vinter, a former KGB operative and Lane's second-in-command Hermione Corfield as an IMF agent who doubles as a record-shop keeper in London Production[edit] Pre-production[edit] Paramount Pictures announced in August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would direct the fifth Mission: Impossible film, from a script by Drew Pearce, with Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. Tom Cruise Productions and Bad Robot would produce, and Skydance Productions, who served as co-financers and executive producers of the latest installment, will work closely with the team in the development and production process.""[5] On November 14, 2013, Paramount announced a release date of December 25, 2015.[6] The same month, Simon Pegg confirmed he would reprise his role as Benji.[7] In May 2014, Will Staples replaced Pearce as screenwriter.[8] Also that month, Jeremy Renner confirmed he was returning in the role of William Brandt,[9] and Cruise said the film would shoot in London,[10] with a later report saying it would first shoot in Vienna in August.[11] At some point, McQuarrie replaced Staples as screenwriter; the final credits list McQuarrie as screenwriter, with story by Pearce. In July 2014, Rebecca Ferguson was cast and Alec Baldwin was in talks for the film.[12][13] Baldwin was confirmed to have joined the cast in August 2014,[14] and Ving Rhames was confirmed to be reprising his role of Luther Stickell.[15] On September 5, it was announced that Sean Harris was in negotiations for the villain role.[16] On October 2, Simon McBurney joined the cast of the film.[17] On October 6, Chinese actress Zhang Jingchu joined the film's cast (she only appears for 30 seconds in the finished film).[18][19] On March 22, 2015, Paramount revealed the film's official title, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, along with a teaser poster and trailer.[20] Filming[edit] This particular Airbus A400M Atlas, registered F-WWMZ, was used to film the action scene at RAF Wittering Principal photography began in August 2014. On August 21, the production released its first photos from the set in Vienna, Austria.[14] In August actors Cruise and Pegg, along with director Christopher McQuarrie, were in Vienna, at the Metro[21] and on the roof-top of Vienna State Opera.[21][22][23] After finishing one and a half weeks of filming in Austria, on August 30, Cruise arrived in the Moroccan capital city of Rabat for filming more scenes.[24][25] Here the Marrakesh Highway was closed for 14 days (August 30–September 12). Other filming locations in Morocco include Agadir, Rabat[26] and.[27][28][29] On September 8 and 9, filming took place in The Marrakesh Stadium, which was closed both days for filming purposes,[30] and Kasbah of the Udayas, in Rabat.[31] After more than a month of shooting in Austria and Morocco, filming moved to London on September 28.[32] On October 10, Cruise and his stuntman Wade Eastwood were filming some scenes in Monaco.[33] Filming of an action scene featuring Ethan Hunt climbing and hanging on the outside of a flying Atlas C1 took place at RAF Wittering near Stamford. Tom Cruise performed the sequence, at times suspended on the aircraft over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in the air, without the use of a stunt double.[34] To pull off this particular stunt, the production team were given a limited period of only 48 hours. The plane took off and landed 8 times before they had the perfect shot.[35] On November 9, filming began on Southampton Water, and Fawley Power Station.[36] Tom Cruise trained under diving specialist Kirk Krack to be able to hold his breath for three minutes to perform an underwater sequence which was filmed in a single long take without any edits (though the scene in the movie was cut with several breaks, giving the impression for the scene having several takes).[37] However, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood claims that Cruise held his breath for just over six minutes.[35] On February 20, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter said filming was halted to give McQuarrie, Cruise, and an unknown third person time to rework the film's ending.[38] Filming ended on March 12, 2015.[39] Soundtrack[edit] The musical score for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously collaborated with director McQuarrie on The Way of the Gun and Jack Reacher. Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in September 2014.[40] The soundtrack was recorded with small orchestral sections at British Grove Studios and with full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.[41][42] As well as incorporating Lalo Schifrin's thematic material from the television series throughout the score, three tracks (""Escape to Danger,"" ""A Matter of Going"", and ""Finale and Curtain Call"") interpolate Puccini's Nessun dorma aria.[42][43] The physical soundtrack became available from La-La Land Records on July 28, 2015, with the digital album released from Paramount Music on the same day.

On January 26, 2015, Paramount advanced the release date to July 31, 2015.[44] The main reason cited by The Hollywood Reporter was to avoid competition with two other 2015 films, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Spectre.[45] In the United States and Canada, it was released in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema, the first ever time for Paramount.[46] On February 13, 2015, Paramount and IMAX Corporation announced that they would digitally re-master the film into the IMAX format and release it in IMAX theaters worldwide on the scheduled date.[47] The film was completed at 2:00AM on July 18, 2015, less than two weeks before its release date. The film was officially released in North America on July 31, 2015. Lotte released the film in South Korea on July 30, 2015.[48] The film was released in China on September 8, 2015.[49] In August 2015, Fox Networks acquired the US cable broadcast rights, for broadcast after its theatrical release. The film will be available for FX Networks and its suite of networks: FX, FXX, FXM, and the video-on-demand platform FXNow.[50] Marketing[edit] A teaser trailer for the film was released on March 22, 2015.[51] The following day, a full-length trailer was released.[52] A second full-length trailer was released on June 3, 2015. Paramount Pictures spent $42 million on advertising for the film.[53] A comic book was released in conjunction with the film's DVD/Blu-ray release. It follows Hunt going rogue during the events of the film. The comic is written by the film's writer and director Christopher McQuarrie and illustrations by Lazarus artist Owen Freeman.[54] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation grossed $195 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $487.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $682.7 million.[3] Although Rogue Nation was projected to become the highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the biggest movie for Cruise,[55] it apparently fell short of eclipsing Ghost Protocol's final gross to become the second-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the second biggest film for Cruise.[56] It had a worldwide opening of $121 million and an IMAX worldwide opening total of $12.5 million (the third-biggest of July behind The Dark Knight Rises and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2).[57] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $108.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[58] United States and Canada[edit] In the United States and Canada, according to pre-release tracking, the film was projected to earn around $40–50 million in its opening weekend, less than what the first three Mission: Impossible films earned in their initial weekend.[59][60][61] It made $4 million from its Thursday night showings which began at 8 p.m. from 2,764 theaters,[62][63] and $20.3 million on its opening day, which is the second-biggest opening day for Cruise (behind War of the Worlds) and the biggest in the Mission: Impossible franchise (breaking Mission: Impossible 2's record), with 16% of ticket sales from the film's 367 IMAX theaters.[59][64][65] In its opening weekend the film grossed $55.5 million exceeding expectations and is the second-highest opening in the franchise, behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($57.8 million) and the third-biggest for Cruise behind War of the Worlds ($64.8 million) and Mission: Impossible 2.[66][67] IMAX contributed $8.4 million of the total opening gross from 369 IMAX screens which is the third-best for a July opening after The Dark Knight Rises ($19 million) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 ($15.2 million). Premium large format grossed up $2.6 million, 13% of Friday's gross with Cinemark XD grossing close to $700,000 at 108 screens.[66] It remained at the top spot for the second weekend earning an estimated $28.5 million (down 48.7%) from 3,988 theaters (32+ theaters) buoyed by strong word of mouth, rapturous reviews and strong plays at IMAX theaters.[68] Revenues from IMAX also dropped steadily by 39% to $4.3 million in its second weekend.[69] It topped the North American box office for two consecutive weekends until surpassed by the music biographical drama Straight Outta Compton in its third weekend.[70][71][72] It ended its theatrical run on October 29, 2015, playing in theaters for a total of 91 days, or 13 weeks, earning a total of $195 million at the North American box office which is just 28.6% of its total worldwide gross.[3] It is the third-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($215 million) and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol ($209 million).[56] Other countries[edit] Elsewhere, the film opened in 40 overseas markets including 135 IMAX theaters on July 31, 2015 in big markets such the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia.[59] It grossed $64.5 million in its opening weekend and went No. 1 in 33 markets and IMAX contributed $4.1 million of its international opening.[57] Revenues from its second weekend increased by 0.5% to $65 million. It added 18 new markets including India, Japan, and Russia and opened at No. 1 in 17 of the 18 markets with the exception of Japan where it was behind Jurassic World.[73] Overall, it opened at No. 1 in 55 of the 63 territories it has been released in and had the biggest opening weekend ever for the franchise in 46 markets and Cruise's best opening in 40 markets.[57][73][74] It topped the box office outside of North America for three consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Paramount's own Terminator Genisys in its fourth weekend[74][75] and four in total.[76] It had the biggest opening for the franchise in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($8.3 million), France ($7 million), India ($6.5 million), Japan ($6.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($5.3 million), Mexico ($5 million), the Middle East ($4.7; including $2.5 million from UAE alone), Taiwan ($5.1 million), Australia ($3.8 million), Germany ($3.2 million) and Brazil ($3.1 million).[57][73][75][77] In South Korea, where the franchise has been a hit it opened to $16.95 million (49% above Ghost Protocol), which is the second-biggest opening ever for Paramount, behind Transformers: Dark of the Moon; Cruise's biggest-ever opening; the best for the Mission: Impossible franchise; and the second-biggest opening for a Western film of 2015.[57][78] It added $8.1 and $3.7 million in its second and third weekend for a total of $41.1 million making South Korea the film's second-highest market followed by Japan ($41.2 million), the United Kingdom ($32 million), France ($20.9 million), and Germany ($13 million).[79][80][81][82] In Japan, it faced competition with the continued run of Jurassic World.[83] In China, Rogue Nation emerged very successful and earned $18.5 million on its opening day of September 8 (including $1.4 million from midnight screenings), which is the country's biggest opening for a Hollywood 2D film, the second-biggest for any 2D film in China (only behind the $22.2 million debut of local 2D film Pancake Man), and the fifth-biggest opening for any film.[84][85] Despite opening on a Tuesday—during which most children are off to school—the film opened successfully and almost matched the opening figure of North America. Rob Cain of Forbes cited out possible reasons for the successful opening: the well-establishment of the franchise in China (its immediate predecessor Ghost Protocol earned $102.7 million), rapid expansion and growth of Chinese movie market, being the second Hollywood movie (after Terminator Genisys) to be released after the nearly 60-day blackout period in which non-Chinese movies were dabarred from going to general release in the country, and the successful awareness campaign and marketing efforts by the team including Tom Cruise visiting several Chinese cities.[85] It went on to earn an estimated $85.8 million through its opening weekend (Tuesday–Sunday) from 5,500 screens.[76] It is the highest-grossing 2D Hollywood film there with $136.8 million (breaking Interstellar's record).[81][82][86][87] Rogue Nation was projected to make roughly 70% of its worldwide gross abroad,[64] and indeed ended up making $487,287,762 or 71.4% of its entire worldwide gross overseas[3] which is the highest among the series.[56] Critical response[edit] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation has a rating of 93% based on 293 reviews and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation continues the franchise's thrilling resurgence—and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal.""[88] Metacritic gives the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[89] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of ""A–"" on an A+ to F scale.[90] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film ""preposterously enjoyable"" and said that it ""unfolds with fluid, twisty, old-school pleasure,"" highlighting the performances of Cruise, Pegg, Ferguson, and Baldwin and comparing the action scenes to those of the James Bond films as well as Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). He ultimately gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.[91] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Rogue Nation 3.5 out of 4 stars, highly praising the film's cast and stating that the film ""keeps topping itself"". However, he criticized the villain for not being too memorable or intimidating.[92] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that McQuarrie's direction allowed Rogue Nation to stand out among the other films in terms of action and its inclusion of female characters, singling out Ferguson's Ilsa as uniquely empowered and action-oriented, also praising her scenes with Cruise.[93] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic praised Cruise, saying ""You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer, unvarnished willpower, a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance"" and describing him as the driving force of the film and the franchise. He, too, praised Ferguson among the supporting cast for her role as an action heroine.[94] Joseph Wigler of MTV.com considered the movie as ""one of the most entertaining Ethan Hunt adventures"" which proves that ""the franchise still has plenty of fight left in it, with no signs of slowing down.""[95] He praised the performances of Cruise and Ferguson,[95] applauding the latter for playing ""the most fascinating character in the entire movie"" and ""one of the most complicated and alluring characters in the entire five film series.""[96] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated ""Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, 'Rogue Nation' is pretty much like most of the 'Impossible' movies in that it’s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star.""[97] A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club remarked, ""Rather than go full auteur on his formulaic material, McQuarrie instead offers a kind of greatest-hits package: 'Rogue Nation' marries the shifting loyalties of Brian De Palma's original to the kinetic action beats of John Woo’s series nadir and the all-set-piece structure of Brad Bird's series zenith, adding an omnipotent villain not far removed from the one Philip Seymour Hoffman played in J.J. Abrams' entry. It’s the least visually or conceptually distinctive of the five movies, leaning on what's worked before rather than forging its own path.""[98] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, calling it ""breathlessly thrilling"" and giving high praise to its action sequences, saying "" all you can do is pick your jaw off your lap and grin at the breathtakingly bananas spectacle you've just witnessed.""[99] Meanwhile, David Edelstein of Vulture.com called Ferguson the ""best reason"" to see the film. However, he felt it did not surpass its predecessor and singled out several elements of some of the action sequences for criticism.[100] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal also praised Ferguson but felt that she and Cruise had ""zero chemistry"" onscreen. Nonetheless, he praised the film for working ""ingenious changes on old tropes"".[101] Daniel Krupa of IGN only gave the film a score of 7/10, praising the action sequences and the performances of the central cast but criticizing it for not adding enough to the series or expanding on the plot of Ghost Protocol.[102] Accolades[edit] By May 2015, Paramount was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Cruise, Abrams, Ellison, and Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development.[114] Christopher McQuarrie returned to write and direct the film, which began filming April 2017 for a July 2018 release.[115] References[edit] ^ a b c d e Grierson, Tim (July 23, 2015).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Fallout,"Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an upcoming American action spy film written, directed and produced by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the sixth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series and stars Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin, and Sean Harris who all reprise their roles from previous films. Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, Sian Brooke, and Angela Bassett will join the franchise. The film is scheduled to be released on July 27, 2018, and will be the first in the series to be released in RealD 3D and IMAX 3D. The film will also have a 2D IMAX release. McQuarrie is also the first director to direct two films in the franchise. Premise[edit] When an IMF mission ends badly, the world is faced with dire consequences. As Ethan Hunt takes it upon himself to fulfill his original briefing, the CIA begins to question his loyalty and his motives. Hunt finds himself in a race against time, hunted by assassins and former allies while trying to prevent a global catastrophe. Production[edit] On May 23, 2015, The Tracking Board reported that Paramount Pictures was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film with Tom Cruise, J. J. Abrams for Bad Robot, and David Ellison and Dana Goldberg returning to produce the film for Skydance, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development.[13] On July 28, 2015, Cruise confirmed on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart that a sixth film was already being developed, and he told Jon Stewart that the shooting of the film would start in summer 2016.[14] Later on August 2, 2015, Paramount's executive Rob Moore told Variety that the sequel was already in works, stating that they were ""very happy to be developing this movie with Tom,"" and ""there has to be another movie.""[15] On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Paramount had hired again Christopher McQuarrie to write the film while it was possible that he would also direct the film, and the studio was moving fast with plans for shooting to start in August 2016.[16] On November 30, 2015, McQuarrie confirmed through his Twitter account that he would be back for directing duty as well, and would also produce the film along with Cruise.[17][18] On December 8, 2015, Showbiz411 confirmed that the fifth film's female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, would be returning for the sequel.[2] On August 19, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Paramount had halted pre-production on the film due to dispute over salary between Cruise and the studio, which Cruise wanted to get equal or more what he was being paid by Universal Studios for the film The Mummy.[19] On September 16, THR confirmed that Cruise's dispute over salary with the studio had been resolved and the production would now begin in Spring 2017.[1] In November, Jeremy Renner—who portrayed William Brandt in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation—stated that he was unsure if he would be part of the sixth film, due to scheduling conflicts with Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and its untitled sequel (2019).[20] His non-inclusion was confirmed in March 2017 at CinemaCon.[3] In February, McQuarrie revealed that the film would include more backstory to Hunt's personal life.[21] On June 13, 2017, Michelle Monaghan was announced to return as Ethan Hunt's wife Julia Meade.[4] Filming[edit] Filming was slated to start in Paris on April 10.[22] Other locations include Britain, India, New Zealand and Norway.[23][24] Filming officially began on April 8, 2017.[25] Some of the filming was also taking place in New Zealand in July 2017.[26] The municipality of Forsand in Norway allowed the closing of Preikestolen for a time in autumn for the film's shoot; only crew members and cast were allowed to approach the mountain for nine consecutive days. They also were allowed up to 50 helicopter landings per day.[27] In August 2017, Cruise injured his right leg on the London set during filming.[28][29] Following his accident, the studio halted the production for at least nine weeks which would be taken to heal Cruise's broken ankle and other injuries, and released a statement saying that they would be keeping the July 2018 release date for the film.[30] Filming resumed in early October 2017, with Tom Cruise spotted on set seven weeks after his initial injury, and two weeks earlier than initially planned.[31] Reshoots for Cavill's Justice League coincided with the schedule for Fallout, for which he had grown a moustache which he was contracted to keep while filming, so Justice League's VFX team was forced to use special effects to digitally remove it in post-production.[32] On January 25, 2018, the title was revealed to be Mission: Impossible – Fallout.[33] Filming concluded on March 25, 2018 in United Arab Emirates.[34] Release[edit] Mission: Impossible – Fallout is scheduled to be released on July 27, 2018, by Paramount Pictures in RealD 3D, IMAX and IMAX 3D.[35] The first trailer was released on February 4, 2018 during Super Bowl LII.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ a b Kit, Borys (September 16, 2016).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(film_series),"Mission: Impossible is a series of action spy films based on the television series of the same name, produced by and starring Tom Cruise as an agent of the fictional Impossible Missions Force (IMF), Ethan Hunt. Beginning in 1996, the films follow the missions of the IMF's main field team under the leadership of Hunt, who is forced to take over after the team is betrayed from within in the first film. The series focuses on Hunt as the lead character as opposed to the ensemble cast structure of the television series, although some characters, such as Luther Stickell (played by American actor Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (played by British actor Simon Pegg) have recurring roles in the films. The series is the 20th-highest-grossing film series of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $2.7 billion to date.[2] A sixth film, titled Mission: Impossible – Fallout is set to be released in July 2018. Mission: Impossible (1996)[edit] Ethan Hunt is framed for the murder of his fellow IMF agents during a Prague Embassy mission gone wrong and falsely accused of selling government secrets to a mysterious international criminal known only as ""Max"". The action spy film was directed by Brian De Palma, and was produced by and starred Tom Cruise. Work on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script. De Palma came up with some action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events. U2 band members Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton produced an electronic dance version of the original theme song. The song went into top ten of music charts around the world, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The film was the third-highest-grossing of the year and received positive reviews from film critics.

Critical and public response[edit] Controversy[edit] Some fans of the TV series were upset that Jim Phelps, team leader in the series, became a traitor in the first movie, selling the details of government agents to an arms dealer. Actor Greg Morris, who portrayed Barney Collier in the original television series, was so disgusted with the film's treatment of the Phelps character that he walked out of the theater before the film ended.[21] Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the original series, was equally negative concerning the films. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated: ""When they were working on an early incarnation of the first one – not the script they ultimately did – they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that"", he said. ""It was basically an action-adventure movie and not 'Mission.' 'Mission' was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it. The script wasn't that good either.""[22] Peter Graves turned down an offer to portray Jim Phelps in the 1996 film because of Phelps being an antagonist.[23] Change to theme song[edit] The television version is in a rarely used 5/4 (five quarter-notes to a measure) time and is difficult to dance to,[24] as was proven by a memorable segment of American Bandstand in which teenage dancers were caught off-guard by Dick Clark's playing of the Lalo Schifrin single release. The opening theme music for the first three films are stylized renditions of Schifrin's original iconic theme, preserving the 5/4 rhythm, by Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, and Michael Giacchino respectively by the films' chronology. Most of the versions included in the score also retained the 5/4 time signature.[24] However, for Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr.'s remix featured on the first film's motion picture soundtrack, the time signature was changed to standard pop 4/4 (four quarter-notes to a measure) time to make it more dance-friendly, although the intro is still in 5/4 time.[24] Also, the Limp Bizkit song ""Take a Look Around"" from the soundtrack to the second film was set to a similar 4/4 modification of the theme, with an interlude in 5/4.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(film),"Mission: Impossible is a 1996 American action spy film directed by Brian De Palma, produced by and starring Tom Cruise. Based on the television series of the same name, the plot follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his mission to uncover the mole who has framed him for the murders of his entire Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team. Work on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script: De Palma devised several action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events. U2 band members Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton produced an electronic dance version of the original theme music. The tune went into the top-ten lists of music charts around the world and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The film was a commercial success, eventually becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1996, and received a mixed-to-favourable response from critics. The film's success spawned the Mission: Impossible film series. Years after the events of the series, Jim Phelps and his team, the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), attempt to retrieve the CIA non-official cover (NOC) list from the American embassy in Prague. Their mission fails: Phelps is shot, his wife Claire dies in a car bombing, and the rest of the team except Ethan Hunt are eliminated by unknown assassins. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the job was a setup to lure out a mole within IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as ""Max"" as part of ""Job 314."" As Hunt is the only member left, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees. Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes ""Job 314"" refers to Bible verse Job 3:14, ""Job"" being the mole's code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining she escaped the bomb after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that the list she possesses has a tracking device. He promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job's identity. Hunt, Max, and her agents escape just as a CIA team arrives. Hunt recruits two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, steal the real list, and flee to London. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from Liverpool Street Station. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt realizes Phelps is the mole, having discovered that Phelps stole a Gideons Bible from a Chicago hotel. He also suspects Krieger as the one who killed the other IMF members on the Prague job, but is unsure whether Claire was involved. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the TGV train to Paris the next day. On the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and gives Hunt the code to a briefcase containing the payment along with Job in the baggage car. Ethan calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Ethan will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Ethan, since they will need a fall guy for the money, when Phelps reveals himself to be Ethan in disguise, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole. Phelps threatens to kill Ethan, but shoots Claire instead when she intervenes. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents, but Hunt is unsure if he'll accept. As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is ready to take on a new mission, just as she asked Phelps at the beginning. Production[edit] Development and writing[edit] Paramount Pictures owned the rights to the television series and had tried for years to make a film version but had failed to come up with a viable treatment. Tom Cruise had been a fan of the show since he was young and thought that it would be a good idea for a film.[4] The actor chose Mission: Impossible to be the first project of his new production company and convinced Paramount to put up a $70 million budget.[5] Cruise and his producing partner, Paula Wagner, worked on a story with filmmaker Sydney Pollack for a few months when the actor hired Brian De Palma to direct.[6] They went through two screenplay drafts that no one liked. De Palma brought in screenwriters Steve Zaillian, David Koepp, and finally Robert Towne. According to the director, the goal of the script was to ""constantly surprise the audience.""[6] Reportedly, Koepp was paid $1 million to rewrite an original script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. According to one project source, there were problems with dialogue and story development. However, the basic plot remained intact.[7] The film went into pre-production without a script that the filmmakers wanted to use.[6] De Palma designed the action sequences but neither Koepp nor Towne were satisfied with the story that would make these sequences take place. Towne ended up helping organize a beginning, middle and end to hang story details on while De Palma and Koepp worked on the plot.[6] De Palma convinced Cruise to set the first act of the film in Prague, a city rarely seen in Hollywood films at the time.[5] Reportedly, studio executives wanted to keep the film's budget in the $40–50 million range, but Cruise wanted a ""big, showy action piece"" that took the budget up to the $62 million range.[7] The scene that takes place in a glass-walled restaurant with a big lobster tank in the middle and three huge fish tanks overhead was Cruise's idea.[5] There were 16 tons in all of the tanks and there was a concern that when they detonated, a lot of glass would fly around. De Palma tried the sequence with a stuntman, but it did not look convincing and he asked Cruise to do it, despite the possibility that the actor could have drowned.[5] The script that Cruise approved called for a final showdown to take place on top of a moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the TGV[5] but rail authorities did not want any part of the stunt performed on their trains.[6] When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission.[6] Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it.[5] For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity that would look visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face.[5] Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the Glasgow South Western Line, between New Cumnock, Dumfries and Annan. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at Industrial Light & Magic.[8] The filmmakers delivered the film on time and under budget with Cruise doing most of his own stunts.[4] Initially, there was a sophisticated opening sequence that introduced a love triangle between Phelps, his wife and Ethan Hunt that was removed because it took the test audience ""out of the genre"", according to De Palma.[6] There were rumors that the actor and De Palma did not get along and they were fueled by the director excusing himself at the last moment from scheduled media interviews before the film's theatrical release.[4] The film uses Lalo Schifrin's original ""Theme from Mission: Impossible"". However, originally Alan Silvestri was hired to write the film score and had, in fact, recorded somewhere around 23 minutes of the score.[citation needed] During post-production, due to creative differences, Silvestri's music was rejected and replaced with new music by composer Danny Elfman.[citation needed] According to some sources, the decision to replace Silvestri was made by producer Tom Cruise.[9] U2 bandmates Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton were fans of the TV show and knew the original theme music well, but were nervous about remaking Schifrin's legendary theme song.[10] Clayton put together his own version in New York City and Mullen did his in Dublin on weekends between U2 recording sessions. The two musicians were influenced by Brian Eno and the European dance club scene sound of the recently finished album Passengers. They allowed Polygram to pick its favorite and they wanted both. In a month, they had two versions of the song and five remixed by DJs. All seven tracks appeared on a limited edition vinyl release.[10] The song entered the top 10 of music charts around the world, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997, and was a critical and commercial success.[citation needed] Marketing[edit] Apple Computer had a $15 million promotion linked to the film that included a game, print ads and television spot featuring scenes from the TV show turned into the feature film; dealer and in-theater promos; and a placement of Apple personal computers in the film. This was an attempt on Apple's part to improve their image after posting a $740 million loss in its fiscal second quarter.[11] Reception[edit] Original television series cast[edit] Several cast members of the original 1966–73 TV series reacted negatively to the film. Actor Greg Morris, who portrayed Barney Collier in the original television series, was reportedly disgusted with the film's treatment of the Phelps character, and he walked out of the theater before the film ended.[12] Peter Graves, who played Jim Phelps in the original series as well as in the late-1980s revival, also disliked how Phelps turned out in the film.[13] Graves had been asked to reprise Phelps, but turned it down when he learned his character was going to be revealed to be a traitor. Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the original series, expressed his own disapproval concerning the film. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated, ""When they were working on an early incarnation of the first one — not the script they ultimately did — they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that. It was basically an action-adventure movie and not Mission. Mission was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it ... The script wasn't that good either!""[14] Box office[edit] Mission: Impossible opened on May 22, 1996 in 3,012 theaters—the most ever up to that point—and broke the record for a film opening on Wednesday with US$11.8 million, beating the $11.7 million Terminator 2: Judgment Day made in 1991.[15] The film also set house records in several theaters around the United States.[16] Mission: Impossible grossed $75 million in its first six days, surpassing Jurassic Park, and took in more than $56 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, beating out The Flintstones.[17] Cruise deferred his usual $20 million fee for a significant percentage of the box office.[17] The film went on to make $180.9 million in North America and $276.7 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $457.6 million.[18] Critical response[edit] Mission: Impossible received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The film has a 62% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10, with the critical consensus reading, ""Full of special effects, Brian DePalma's update of Mission: Impossible has a lot of sweeping spectacle, but the plot is sometimes convoluted"".[19] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[20] Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, ""This is a movie that exists in the instant, and we must exist in the instant to enjoy it.""[21] In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden addressed the film's convoluted plot: ""If that story doesn't make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn't matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense.""[22] Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and said that it was ""stylish, brisk but lacking in human dimension despite an attractive cast, the glass is either half-empty or half-full here, though the concoction goes down with ease.""[23] However, Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, ""There are empty thrills, and some suspense. But throughout the film, we keep waiting for some trace of personality, some color in the dialogue, some hipness in the staging or in the characters' attitudes. And it's not there.""[24] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, ""What is not present in Mission: Impossible (which, aside from the title, sound-track quotations from the theme song and self-destructing assignment tapes, has little to do with the old TV show) is a plot that logically links all these events or characters with any discernible motives beyond surviving the crisis of the moment.""[25] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a ""B"" rating and said, ""The problem isn't that the plot is too complicated; it's that each detail is given the exact same nagging emphasis. Intriguing yet mechanistic, jammed with action yet as talky and dense as a physics seminar, the studiously labyrinthine Mission: Impossible grabs your attention without quite tickling your imagination.""[26] References[edit] ^ ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (PG)"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Hunt,"Ethan Matthew Hunt is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Mission: Impossible film series. He is portrayed by Tom Cruise and appeared in all five films. Cruise is set to reprise his role in the sixth film which will be released in 2018.[1] Appearances[edit] Mission: Impossible (1996)[edit] In the first film, Hunt acts as the IMF point man for an experienced field team, led by veteran Jim Phelps, with whom he is closely bonded. While attempting to recover stolen files containing information on all IMF's field agents during a mission in Prague, the entire team, barring Hunt, is supposedly killed and the files are stolen, leaving Hunt the only suspect as he learns that the mission was a set-up to expose a mole who had been selling secrets to a Czech arms dealer. Hunt decides to steal the genuine list himself, demanding that the genuine mole be present at the exchange. He sets up a rogue team of other disavowed agents, including computer expert Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Béart), Jim's wife and the only other apparent survivor of the mission. After recovering the list, Hunt is shocked to learn that the true traitor is actually Jim Phelps himself, who was completely unhinged and had become disillusioned with his career after feeling that he had become irrelevant. Phelps faked his own death in order to frame Hunt and was working with Krieger and Claire to eliminate the team's other members. Setting up a situation where Jim's continued survival and his criminal activity is exposed to the head of IMF, Hunt kills Jim and Krieger as they attempt to escape from the train where Hunt had arranged to make the exchange, with Claire being killed in the crossfire. At the conclusion of the film, Hunt meets briefly with Stickell and is taking over Jim's position. Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)[edit] The second film in the series was directed by action filmmaker John Woo in 2000. In the film, Hunt is tasked with retrieving a deadly genetically engineered virus, known as ""Chimera"", from a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who intends to release the virus after acquiring a controlling influence on the company that created it so that he can profit from sales of the cure. Hunt attempts to infiltrate Ambrose's inner circle through Ambrose's former girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), an accomplished thief. During their mission, Hunt and Nordoff-Hall engage in an affair that complicates the mission. At the climax, Nordoff-Hall is forced to infect herself with the last virus in order to save Hunt; with Hunt having destroyed the only other traces of the virus, she was thus able to shield Hunt until he could escape. Subsequently racing against time—the virus is incurable twenty hours after infection—Hunt manages to acquire the cure and kill Ambrose. Mission: Impossible III (2006)[edit] In the third film, Hunt is now a semi-retired training officer for IMF and plans a quiet life with his fiancée Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), who doesn't know about the IMF. He is called back into service to rescue a former student captured during a mission in Germany, and recovers confidential information via stolen laptop. He is forced to once again go rogue in an attempt to track down the sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and secure a dangerous mystery item known as the 'Rabbit's Foot'. After an impromptu ceremony, Hunt and Julia are married, only for Owen, who has a double agent working within IMF, to kidnap Julia. With the help of his IMF team (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Maggie Q), Hunt finds the Rabbit's foot, saves his wife, and kills Owen Davian in Shanghai. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)[edit] In the fourth film, Hunt—having just escaped from a deep-cover mission in prison—and his IMF team are blamed for an attack that destroys the Kremlin, resulting in the disavowal of the entire IMF. Despite lacking their usual resources, connections, technology, and backup, their mission is to find and stop Kurt Hendricks, a former Soviet nuclear strategist who is intent on starting a nuclear war to usher in the next era of human evolution. As they chase Hendricks to Dubai and on to India, they themselves are pursued by a team of Russian agents trying to apprehend them. The team becomes increasingly fractured as individual members fight their own demons while trying to trust the others. Hunt manages to pull the team together, stop a nuclear bomb and clear the IMF of any involvement in the Kremlin attack. It is also revealed that Hunt had Julia's death faked to protect her, something only he and the Secretary of IMF knew about, giving him the pretext to infiltrate the prison his team freed him from in the opening scenes. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)[edit] At the beginning of the fifth film, Hunt is assigned a mission that culminates in him hanging outside of an A400M military aircraft 5,000 feet above the ground in Belarus to recover a package that contains VX nerve gas. Although this mission succeeds, when he learns that the thieves responsible for stealing the gas lacked the connections to do so, Hunt begins to uncover evidence of the existence of the Syndicate, essentially an 'anti-IMF' with all of the organisation's training and skills but used for criminal purposes. After Hunt is forced to go off-the-grid when he is nearly killed by a Syndicate operative and the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA due to its controversial and destructive methods, he spends six months trying to track the Syndicate. Eventually, he and his former team learn that the Syndicate was actually originally a British project to perform missions without oversight, but British agent Solomon Lane took the plans and went rogue, now seeking to steal files that would grant him access to various established bank accounts to finance future Syndicate operations. Refusing to allow the Syndicate to continue, Hunt and his team are able to capture Lane, with CIA Director Alan Hunley subsequently forced to claim that the disbanding of IMF was a cover to allow them to track the Syndicate. Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018)[edit] Hunt will appear in the sixth film, Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Video games[edit] Aside from the Mission: Impossible films, Ethan Hunt has appeared in the 1998 video game based on the first film and the 2003 video game Mission: Impossible – Operation Surma, voiced by Steve Blum. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover game Lego Dimensions, with archive footage from the first film being used for his voice. References[edit]"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_2,"Mission: Impossible 2 (also stylized as Mission: Impossible II[1][4] and abbreviated as M:I-2[1]) is a 2000 American action spy film directed by John Woo and starring Tom Cruise, who also served as the film's producer. It is the second installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. In the film, Ethan Hunt is recruited by the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) to find and destroy a dangerous biological weapon called ""Chimera"" from a rogue IMF agent named Sean Ambrose with the help of his new girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Mission: Impossible 2 was released in theaters worldwide on May 24, 2000. It grossed more than $546.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film of 2000. Reviews were mixed to positive; praise was directed at Tom Cruise's performance and the action sequences, but the plot and dialogue were criticized. Ethan Hunt is alerted by the IMF that someone has used his identity to assist bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich to enter the United States, only to kill him in a subsequent plane crash. Nekhorvich, an old friend of Ethan, had forewarned the IMF of his arrival, planning to deliver to them a new bioweapon, Chimera, and its cure, Bellerophon. He was forced to develop these by Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. IMF determines that rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose is responsible. IMF assigns Ethan to recover the virus and its cure. It also insists that he recruits Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain. Later, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. After recruiting Nyah, Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to learn about the Chimera virus. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues. He then blackmails McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals video footage and transfers it to Ethan. Ethan's team learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. The IMF team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, they learn that the only samples of Bellerophon were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus (which Nekhorvich injected himself with). As a result, Ambrose forced McCloy to exchange a sample of the virus for a sample of Bellerophon. The team break into Biocyte to destroy the virus. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing his plan. Ambrose captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of the virus before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the last sample of Chimera. She injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her to get it. Ambrose takes Nyah away, and Ethan escapes from the laboratory. Ambrose lets Nyah wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him the majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent Chimera from spreading. Ethan eventually gains the upper hand over Ambrose and kills him. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan, takes Bellerophon and injects Nyah with it. IMF clears Nyah's criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney. Anthony Hopkins has an uncredited cameo role as Mission Commander Swanbeck.[5] Production[edit] According to screenwriter Robert Towne several action sequences were already planned for the film prior to his involvement and before the story had been written.[6] The studio expressed concern over the safety of shooting Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)'s entrance in the film, where he is free solo climbing in Moab, Utah's Dead Horse Point State Park.[7] Cruise refused to drop the idea because he could not think of a better way to reintroduce the character. There was no safety net as he filmed the sequence, but he did have a harness. He tore his shoulder when performing Hunt's jump from one part of the cliff to another.[8] Marketing[edit] The first trailer to the film was released in November 1999 and was later shown before Pokemon: The First Movie. The film's original score was composed by Hans Zimmer and features vocals performed by Lisa Gerrard.[9] In addition, the film includes contemporary music such as Limp Bizkit's rendition of Lalo Schifrin's Mission: Impossible theme entitled ""Take a Look Around"" as well as Metallica's ""I Disappear"".[10] While vacationer Ethan is rock climbing, Zap Mama's remixed version of ""Iko Iko"" plays on the soundtrack. Reception[edit] Box office[edit] In its North American opening weekend, the film grossed $57,845,297, ranking at #1. It held on to the No. 1 spot for three weekends. The film eventually grossed $215,409,889 in its North American release and $330,978,216 in other territories, totaling $546,388,105 worldwide, the highest-grossing film of 2000.[3] It was also John Woo's highest grossing film of all time. Critical response[edit] Mission: Impossible 2 received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising the fast-paced action scenes, Tom Cruise's performance and Hans Zimmer's musical score, but criticizing the plot, dialogue, little resemblance to its source material, and overall lack of substance. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes indicates the film was certified as ""Rotten"" with overall approval rating of 57% based on 143 reviews, with an average score of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Your cranium may crave more substance, but your eyes will feast on the amazing action sequences"".[11] Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[12] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said that ""if the first movie was entertaining as sound, fury, and movement, this one is more evolved, more confident, more sure-footed in the way it marries minimal character development to seamless action.""[4] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly felt the film was a ""throwaway pleasure"" but also ""a triumph of souped-up action.""[13] Ella Taylor of LA Weekly said that ""every car chase, every plane crash, every potential drop off a cliff is a masterpiece of grace and surprise.""[14] Desson Howe of The Washington Post said that ""[John] Woo [...] takes complete command of the latest technology to create brilliant action sequences.""[15] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, ""Check your brains at the popcorn stand and hang on for a spectacular ride.""[16] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice called the film ""a vaguely absurd thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs.""[17] Dennis Harvey of Variety said the film is ""even more empty a luxury vehicle than its predecessor"" and that it ""pushes the envelope in terms of just how much flashy packaging an audience will buy when there's absolutely nada inside.""[18] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader said that ""no hero or villain winds up carrying any moral weight at all.""[19] In a retrospective commentary in 2012, Brad Brevet noted the film has significant similarities in plot and themes to Alfred Hitchcock's 1946 film Notorious.[20] Mission: Impossible 2 was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards at the 2000 ceremony, including Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton.[21] A comedy short titled Mission: Improbable was shown during the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. It is a mockumentary of the behind-the-scenes stunts of Mission: Impossible 2, and stars Cruise, Ben Stiller, and Woo. See also[edit] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f ""Mission: Impossible II (2000)"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_III,"Mission: Impossible III (stylized as M:i:III) is a 2006 American action spy film co-written and directed by J. J. Abrams in his directorial debut and starring Tom Cruise, who also served as a producer, in the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt. It is the third installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. In the film, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has retired from field work for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and trains new recruits. However, he is sent back into action to track down the elusive arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2006, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2006, by Paramount Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success.[3] A sequel, entitled Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, was released in December 2011. Ethan Hunt has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's true job. He is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell. The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp. IMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object called the ""Rabbit's Foot"". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian. On the flight back to the U.S., Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about Rabbit's foot, but Davian remains tightlipped. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel is attacked, and Davian escapes. Ethan races to Julia's workplace, only to find she has already been kidnapped. Davian gives Ethan 48 hours to recover the Rabbit's Foot in exchange for Julia's life, but Ethan is soon captured by the IMF. Musgrave takes part in Ethan's interrogation but discreetly mouths that the Rabbit's Foot is located in Shanghai, China, and provides Ethan with the means to escape. Ethan escapes IMF headquarters, travels to Shanghai, and acquires Rabbit's Foot along with his team. As he delivers Rabbit's Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, he realizes a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. The restrained Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit's Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves. Musgrave arrives and explains that the woman killed was not Julia, but Davian's head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of Rabbit's Foot. Julia is alive and held as hostage. Musgrave reveals himself as the mole. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit's Foot and sell to a terrorist group, so that IMF would have reasons to launch a preemptive strike. When Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan knocks him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave's phone to track the last call's location to find Julia. He arrives and finds the place, but encounters Davian. Davian triggers the micro-explosive in Ethan's head, but Ethan kills him and then jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Before electrocuting himself, he kisses Julia and teaches her how to use his Beretta 92 to defend herself. While Ethan is unconscious, Musgrave and a henchman arrive and Julia shoots them dead. She successfully revives Ethan and he explains his true IMF career to her. Back in the U.S., Ethan is congratulated by Brassel as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.

At that point, when you own a franchise like that, you want to get rid of any extraneous opinions."" —David Fincher, on contributing to a film series[4] In 2002, director David Fincher was slated to direct the next installment of the Mission: Impossible film series for a summer of 2004 release date.[5] Fincher, however, dropped out in favor of another film,[6] later citing creative differences over the direction of the series.[4] Replacing Fincher was director Joe Carnahan, who worked on developing the film for 15 months.[7] Under his involvement, the film was to feature ""Kenneth Branagh playing a guy who's based on Timothy McVeigh,"" as well as Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson in other roles.[8] Thandie Newton was offered to reprise her role as Nyah Nordoff-Hall from Mission: Impossible 2; she declined, however. After a dispute over the film's tone, Carnahan quit in July 2004.[6] Tom Cruise then called J. J. Abrams, offering the directorial role for the film after having binge-watched the first two seasons of Alias.[9] Abrams ultimately signed on, with production delayed a year due to his contractual obligations with Alias and Lost.[10] During this time, Branagh, Moss, and Johansson departed from the project because of the many delays in production.[6][11] On June 8, 2005, Paramount Pictures gave the film the green-light after a new cast of actors was hired and the film's budget was redeveloped, with Cruise taking a major pay cut.[11] Filming[edit] Principal photography began in Rome, Italy on July 18, 2005 and ended in October. Location filming took place in China (Shanghai and Xitang), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Rome and Caserta), the United States (California, Virginia and Maryland), and Vatican City. The night scenes involving the skyscrapers were filmed in Shanghai, while some of the Shanghai filming was also done in Los Angeles.[9] The film's musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino. He is the third composer to take on the series, following Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. The score album was released on May 9, 2006 by Varèse Sarabande Records. Unlike the previous installments, no soundtrack album featuring the film's contemporary music was released. Despite this, the film features a song by Kanye West entitled ""Impossible"" that also features Twista, Keyshia Cole and BJ.[12] Distribution[edit] Marketing[edit] To promote the film, Paramount rigged 4,500 randomly selected Los Angeles Times vending boxes with digital audio players which would play the theme song when the door was opened. The audio players did not always stay concealed, and in many cases came loose and fell on top of the stack of newspapers in plain view, with the result that they were widely mistaken for bombs. Police bomb squads detonated a number of the vending boxes and even temporarily shut down a veterans hospital in response to the apparent ""threat"". Despite these problems, Paramount and the Los Angeles Times opted to leave the audio players in the boxes until two days after the movie's opening.[13] ""Trapped in the Closet"" controversy[edit] A blog entry of Hollywoodinterrupted.com in March 2006 alleged that Viacom (parent of Paramount and Comedy Central) canceled the rebroadcast of the South Park episode ""Trapped in the Closet"" due to threats by Cruise to refuse to participate in the Mission: Impossible III publicity circle.[14][15] These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and American Morning.[15][16] Fox News attributed threats from Cruise, stating, ""to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn't pull a repeat of the episode"", as evidence of ""bad blood"" between Cruise and Viacom.[17] The Washington Post reported that South Park fans ""struck back"", in March 2006, and threatened to boycott Mission: Impossible III until Comedy Central put ""Trapped in the Closet"" back on its schedule.[18] Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the film's box office debut.[19] Political blogger Andrew Sullivan encouraged a boycott of the film, based on claims that Cruise allegedly forced Comedy Central to censor a South Park episode about Scientologists. ""Make sure you don't go see Paramount's Mission: Impossible III, Cruise's upcoming movie,"" Sullivan wrote. ""I know you weren't going to see it anyway. But now any money you spend on this movie is a blow against freedom of speech. Boycott it. Tell your friends to boycott it.""[20] When asked in ABC's Primetime about his involvement with stopping the episode rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated ""First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'""[21] A representative of Cruise had also denied any involvement of Cruise with the issue, specifically responding to allegations of Cruise's reputed corporate power play.[22] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Opening in 4,054 theaters all across the United States,[23] the fourth largest opening ever up to that point,[24] the film topped the box office in its opening weekend. It made $16.6 million on its opening day and $47.7 million in its opening weekend,[23] a solid opening yet almost $10 million lower than the franchise's previous films.[25] The film remained at number one with $25 million during its second weekend, ahead of Poseidon's gross of $22.2 million.[23] The film remained in the Top 10 at the box office for the remainder of its first six weeks.[23] It ended its initial domestic run on July 20, 2006, taking in a total of $134 million.[23] It was the second movie in 2006 to pass the $100,000,000 mark in the box office, following Ice Age: The Meltdown.[citation needed] The $134 million domestic run was significantly lower than that of Mission Impossible II,[23] as well as box office analysts' expectations.[who?][citation needed] Outside the US, the film grossed $70 million during its first five days (in some Asian countries, it opened two days ahead of its North American release date) and was easily the box-office champion in many countries.[23] As of 2017, its international box office gross has reached $263.8 million for a combined worldwide gross of $397.9 million, the lowest so far of the series.[23] In the Netherlands, the film debuted at No. 1 in the week of May 4–10, grossing a total of € 532,384. The following week, the film remained on the top position. In its third, the film dropped to No. 2 and fell to No. 4 to the following week. Next, it maintained the No. 4 position to drop to No. 6 (in the week of June 6 - June 14). In total, the film has grossed over € 2,141,162.[26] Critical response[edit] On the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible III received 70% positive reviews from critics, with an average of 6.6, based on 220 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Fast-paced, with eye-popping stunts and special effects, the latest Mission: Impossible installment delivers everything an action fan could ask for. A thrilling summer popcorn flick.""[27] It holds a similar rating on Metacritic, with an average score of 66/100, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"" based on a normalized average of 42 reviews.[3] On the television show Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper gave Mission: Impossible III a ""thumbs up,"" while Roger Ebert gave it a marginal ""thumbs down.""[28] In Ebert's print review, he gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying, ""Either you want to see mindless action and computer-generated sequences executed with breakneck speed and technical precision, or you do not. I am getting to the point where I don't much care."" He felt ""surprised that the plot hangs together more than in the other two films.""[29] Keith Phipps of The Onion's A.V. Club said the film is ""business as usual, but it's the best kind of business as usual, and it finds everyone working in top form.""[30] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Mission: Impossible III ""a gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence.""[31] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle said that ""it's all poppycock, of course, but it's done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot.""[32] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying that it ""provides lots of action, but too little excitement.""[33] Ian Nathan of Empire said that Mission: Impossible III has ""an inspired middle-hour pumped by some solid action"" but added that ""we now live in a post-Bourne, recalibrated-Bond universe, where Ethan Hunt looks a bit lost.""[34] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that ""Hoffman enlivens Mission: Impossible III"" but criticized the film's ""maudlin romance"" and ""Abrams's inability to adapt his small-screen talent to a larger canvas.""[35] Rob Nelson of the Dallas Observer said that ""Abrams's movie is too oppressive, too enamored of its brutality to deliver anything like real thrills; its deeply unpleasant tone nearly makes you long even for [Mission: Impossible 2 director John] Woo's cartoon absurdities.""[36] Claudia Puig of USA Today said that ""Mission: Impossible III delivers"" despite ""a sense that the franchise is played out and its star over-exposed.""[37] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide described the film as ""breezy, undemanding, and a carefully balanced blend of the familiar and the not-quite-what-you-expected.""[38] Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer said that Mission: Impossible III is ""plenty of fun"" despite being ""overwrought and overplotted.""[39] Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat said that ""you may be mildly entertained, but damned if you'll remember any of it five minutes later.""[40] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com said that ""Cruise is the single bright, blinking emblem of the failure of Mission: Impossible III.""[41] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked that ""the latest [Mission: Impossible film] is just this side of insultingly stupid.""[42] Shawn Levy of The Oregonian said that Mission: Impossible III ""feels like one of the more forgettable James Bond films—saddled, moreover, with a star who's sliding into self-parody.""[43] References[edit] ^ ""MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III (12A)"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Ghost_Protocol,"Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is a 2011 American action spy film directed by Brad Bird and written by Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec. It is the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and also Bird's first live-action film.[4] It stars Tom Cruise, who reprises his role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt, alongside Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, Michael Nyqvist, Anil Kapoor, and Léa Seydoux. Ghost Protocol was produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams (the third film's director) and Bryan Burk. It saw the return of editor Paul Hirsch and visual effects supervisor John Knoll from the first film, and is also the first Mission: Impossible film to be partially filmed using IMAX cameras. Released in North America by Paramount Pictures on December 16, 2011, the film was a critical and commercial success. Ghost Protocol became the highest-grossing film in the series with $694 million,[5] and the highest-grossing film starring Cruise.[6][7][8] A sequel, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, was released in July 2015. IMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in Budapest by assassin Sabine Moreau, who takes the file containing Russian nuclear launch codes he had stolen so she can give them to a man known only as ""Cobalt"". Meanwhile, IMF agent Ethan Hunt has purposely become incarcerated into a Moscow prison to acquire Bogdan, a source of information on Cobalt. With help of Jane Carter, Hanaway's handler, and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn, Hunt and Bogdan make their escape. IMF tasks Hunt to infiltrate the Kremlin to gain more information on Cobalt. During the mission, an unknown entity broadcasts on the IMF frequency ordering the detonation of a bomb. Hunt's team aborts the mission just as a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Carter and Dunn escape, but Hunt is captured by SVR agent Anatoly Sidorov and charged with the destruction of the Kremlin. Hunt is able to escape and regroups with the IMF Secretary who is in Moscow on other business. The Secretary tells Hunt they have had to initiate ""Ghost Protocol"", disavowing IMF, but secretly orders Hunt to continue to pursue Cobalt. Sidorov's forces catch up to Hunt, and the Secretary is killed; Hunt escapes along with the Secretary's aide and intelligence analyst William Brandt. Regrouping with Carter and Dunn, Brandt is able to identify Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist, who seeks to start a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. Hendricks used the Kremlin bombing to cover up his theft of a Russian nuclear launch-control device, and now is planning a trade with Moreau at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai to gain the required launch codes. The team travel to Dubai and create deceptions using their various gadgetry and disguises to make Moreau believe she is meeting with Hendricks, and vice versa, when in fact they are interacting with the IMF team. Moreau discovers the deception, and in the ensuing chaos, Hendricks manages to escape with the launch codes, losing Hunt's pursuit in the midst of a dust storm. Carter knocks Moreau out of a window when she tries to escape. Brandt accuses her of letting her love for Hanaway compromise the mission, but Hunt recognizes that Brandt has also been keeping secrets from them, having shown combat skills atypical of a mere analyst. Hunt leaves to meet with Bogdan to get more information on Hendricks, while Brandt tells the others that he had been assigned to secretly protect Ethan and his wife Julia in Croatia. Julia had been killed by a hit squad and Brandt feels responsible for Ethan's loss, which is why he stopped being a field agent. Bogdan directs Ethan towards Mumbai, where Hendricks is set to negotiate with Indian telecommunications entrepreneur Brij Nath to gain control of an obsolete Soviet military satellite. The IMF team splits up to stop Hendricks; Carter seduces Nath to get the satellite override code, while Hunt, Brandt and Dunn try to stop Hendricks from using Nath's broadcast station. They are too late as Hendricks has sent the launch codes to a Russian Delta III-class nuclear submarine to fire a single missile at San Francisco and disabled the station's computer systems. Brandt and Dunn race to get the systems back online to send the override code, while Hunt pursues Hendricks, eventually fighting him face to face in an automated car park. Hendricks, with the launch device, jumps to his death moments before the missile is to land. Hunt takes a dangerous fall to use the device to disable the missile before it strikes. Sidorov, who has followed IMF from Dubai to Mumbai, arrives and realizes that the IMF is innocent of the Kremlin bombing. The team meets in Seattle after Ethan accepts a new mission from Luther Stickell. Brandt confesses to Ethan about his failure to protect Julia. Ethan, however, reveals that her ""death"" and the murder of the Serbians were part of a plot to give her a new identity and enable Ethan to infiltrate the prison. A relieved Brandt accepts his mission. Ethan and Julia gaze at each other from afar before Ethan departs for his next mission. Production[edit] Despite Mission: Impossible III earning less than its predecessors at the box office, Paramount Pictures was keen on developing a fourth film.[12] In August 2009, Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec were hired to write the film's screenplay.[13] Because of other commitments, J. J. Abrams said that it was unlikely for him to return as director but made note that he will produce the film alongside Tom Cruise.[14] By March 2010, director Brad Bird was in talks of directing the film with Cruise officially returning to star as Ethan Hunt.[15] The film was originally announced with a working name of Mission: Impossible 4 and code-named ""Aries"" during early production.[16] By August 2010, title considerations did not include the Mission: Impossible 4 name, and thought was given to omitting the specific term ""Mission: Impossible"", which Variety compared to Christopher Nolan's Batman sequel film The Dark Knight.[17] In late October 2010, however, the title was confirmed as Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.[18] Christopher McQuarrie (who later directed Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout) did an uncredited rewrite of the screenplay, explaining that: On Ghost Protocol I came in on the middle of the shoot to do a rewrite of the screenplay, though they had already started the movie. I had to communicate with the entire staff to determine what I could and couldn’t change, what sets had been built or struck, what scenes I could or couldn’t reshoot. I learned so much about production being right there. ...The script had these fantastic sequences in it but there was a mystery in it that was very complicated. What I did was about clarity. The mystery had to be made simpler. It’s like reaching into a sock and pulling it inside out. It’s still a sock, still all the same pieces, but all put together in a different order.[19] Filming[edit] The film was partially shot with IMAX cameras, which made up approximately 30 minutes of the film's run time.[20][21] Bird insisted that certain scenes of the film be shot in IMAX, as opposed to 3D, as he felt that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion due to its brighter, higher quality image, which is projected on a larger screen, without the need for specialised glasses.[22] Bird also believed that the IMAX format would bring back ""a level of showmanship"" to the presentation of Hollywood films, which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in multiplexes as opposed to grand theaters, and vetoing ""first runs"" in favor of wider initial releases.[22] ""When we were first looking at the image of Tom climbing the Burj, in the long shots we could not only see the traffic in the reflections when he presses down on the glass... But you actually saw the glass warp slightly because of the pressure of his hand. You would never see that in 35mm. The fact that the screen fills your vision and is super sharp seems more life-like."" —Brad Bird describing the advantages of filming in the IMAX format.[23] Principal photography took place from October 2010 to March 2011.[24] Filming took place in Mumbai, Prague, Moscow, Vancouver, Bangalore, and Dubai.[25][26][27] Tom Cruise performed a sequence where Ethan Hunt scales the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower, which is the world's tallest building, without the use of a stunt double.[28] Although Cruise appears to be free solo climbing in the film with the help of special gloves, in reality, he was securely attached to the Burj Khalifa at all times by multiple cables.[24] Industrial Light & Magic digitally erased the cables in post-production. Following Cruise's example, Patton and Seydoux also chose to forgo the use of stunt doubles for their fight scene at the Burj Khalifa where Carter exacts her revenge upon Moreau for Hanaway's death.[24] Many of the film's interior scenes were shot at Vancouver's Canadian Motion Picture Park Studios, including a key transition scene in a specially equipped IMF train car and the fight between Hunt and Hendricks in a Mumbai automated multi-level parking garage (which was constructed over a six-month period just for the film).[24] The film's climax scene was shot with Indian film actor Anil Kapoor in the Sun Network office in Bangalore.[29][30] Also, the film's opening Moscow prison escape scenes were shot on location in a real former prison near Prague.[24] Bird, having directed several Disney and Pixar films and short films, incorporated the trademark ""A113"" into the film on two separate occasions. The first is the design print on Hanaway's ring during the flashback sequence, and the second being when Hunt calls in for support and uses the drop callsign, Alpha 1-1-3.[31] Soundtrack[edit] The musical score for Ghost Protocol was composed by Michael Giacchino, who also composed the music for the third film and collaborated with Bird on The Incredibles and Ratatouille. As in previous installments, the score incorporates Lalo Schifrin's themes from the original television series.[32] ""Lalo is an amazing jazz writer. You know you can't write a straight-up jazz score for a film like this but you can certainly hint at it here and there,"" said Giacchino, explaining the stylistic influence generated by Schifrin's history with the franchise.[33] A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande on January 10, 2012.[34] All music composed by Michael Giacchino.

One of the many scenes that were included was a chase scene in a Dubai desert sandstorm.[36] During November 2011, the Paramount released a Facebook game of the film in order to promote it. The new game allowed players to choose the roles of IMF agents and assemble teams to embark on a multiplayer journey. Players were also able to garner tickets to the film's U.S. premiere and a hometown screening of the film for 30 friends.[37] Theatrical release[edit] Following the world premiere in Dubai on December 7, 2011,[38] the film was released in IMAX and other large-format theaters in the U.S. on December 16, 2011,[39] with general release on December 21, 2011. Home media[edit] Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download on April 17, 2012.[40] The home media releases, however, do not preserve the original IMAX imagery,[41][42] and its aspect ratio is consistently cropped to 2.40:1 rather than switching to a 1.78:1 aspect ratio during the IMAX scenes. Blu-ray Disc releases such as The Dark Knight,[43] Tron: Legacy,[44] and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen[45] will switch between 2.40:1 for regular scenes and 1.78:1 for IMAX scenes. Reception[edit] Critical response[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 233 reviews and an average rating of 7.7/10, making it the best-reviewed entry of the series. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Stylish, fast-paced, and loaded with gripping set pieces, the fourth Mission: Impossible is big-budget popcorn entertainment that really works.""[46] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[47] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of four stars, saying the film ""is a terrific thriller with action sequences that function as a kind of action poetry"".[48] Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger wrote ""The eye-candy—from high-tech gadgets to gorgeous people—has only been ratcheted up. And so has the excitement."" He also gave the film 3.5 out of four stars.[49] Giving the film three out of four stars, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said ""In its way, the movie has old-Hollywood elegance. The scope and sets are vast, tall, and cavernous, but Bird scales down for spatial intimacy.""[50] Philippa Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the film three stars out of five and said it is ""ludicrously improbable, but also quite fun.""[51] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly opined that the movie ""brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time; they're brought off with such casual aplomb that they're funny, too. ... Ghost Protocol is fast and explosive, but it's also a supremely clever sleight-of-hand thriller. Brad Bird, the animation wizard, ... showing an animator's miraculously precise use of visual space, has a playful, screw-tightening ingenuity all his own.""[52] Roger Moore of The Charlotte Observer said ""Brad Bird passes his audition for a career as a live-action director. And Ghost Protocol more than makes its bones as an argument for why Tom Cruise should continue in this role as long as his knees, and his nerves, hold up."" He gave the film three out of four stars.[53] Box office[edit] Ghost Protocol grossed $209,397,903 in North America and $485,315,477 in other countries for a worldwide total of $694,713,380.[54] It is the highest-grossing film worldwide in the Mission: Impossible series,[55] and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2011.[56] It is also the highest-grossing film worldwide starring Cruise, surpassing War of the Worlds from the top spot.[57] In limited release at 425 locations in North America, it earned $12.8 million over its opening weekend.[58] After five days of limited release, it expanded to 3,448 theaters on its sixth day and reached #1 at the box office with $8.92 million.[59] The film reached the top stop at the box office in its second and third weekends with $29.6 million and $29.4 million respectively.[60][61] Though only 9% of the film's screenings were in IMAX theaters, they accounted for 23% of the film's box office.[62] Outside North America, it debuted to a $69.5 million in 42 markets representing approximately 70% of the marketplace. In the United Arab Emirates, it set an opening-weekend record of $2.4 million (since surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers).[63] In two countries outside the U.S. in which filming took place, its opening weekend gross increased by multiples over the previous installment: in Russia, more than doubling, to $6.08 million[64] and in India, more than quadrupling, to $4.0 million.[65] It is the second highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film outside North America.[66] It topped the box office outside North America for three consecutive weekends (during December 2011)[67] and five weekends in total (the other two in 2012).[57] Its highest-grossing markets after North America are China ($102.5 million),[68] Japan ($69.7 million), and South Korea ($51.1 million).[69] Accolades[edit] In December 2011, Pegg suggested that he and Cruise were interested in returning for a fifth Mission: Impossible film.[76] Paramount was also reportedly interested in fast-tracking a fifth film due to the fourth film's success.[77] Bird had stated that he probably would not return to direct a fifth film, but Tom Cruise had been confirmed to return.[78] It was revealed In August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would be the director of Mission: Impossible 5.[79] Principal photography began in February 2014 in London.[80] Paramount Pictures released the film on July 31, 2015.[81] The plot centers around Hunt's IMF team in conflict with ""the Syndicate"", an international criminal organization first mentioned at the end of Ghost Protocol.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Rogue_Nation,"Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation is a 2015 American action spy film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris, Ving Rhames, Simon McBurney and Tom Hollander, with Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames reprising their roles from previous films. Rogue Nation is produced by Cruise, J. J. Abrams, and David Ellison of Skydance Productions. In the film, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is on the run from the CIA, following the IMF's disbandment as he tries to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a mysterious international terrorist consortium. Filming began on August 21, 2014, in Vienna, Austria, and concluded on March 12, 2015. The film was released in North America by Paramount Pictures on July 31, 2015. In its opening weekend it took in $55.5 million at the U.S. box office[4] and went on to gross $195 million in North America and $682 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the series, as well as the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2015. A sequel, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, is scheduled for release on July 27, 2018 with Simon Pegg returning as Benji Dunn and McQuarrie also returning as writer and director. After intercepting nerve gas being sold to Chechen terrorists in Minsk, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is determined to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a criminal consortium the CIA does not believe exists. Hunt is captured by the Syndicate at a record shop in London, while their leader, a blond man in glasses, kills the IMF agent stationed there. Hunt escapes a torture chamber led by Syndicate member Janik ""Bone Doctor"" Vinter with the help of disavowed MI6 agent and Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust. In Washington, D.C., CIA Director Alan Hunley and IMF Field Operations Director William Brandt testify before a Senate committee. The IMF, currently without a secretary in charge, is controversial because of its destructive methods and various misconducts. Hunley succeeds in having the IMF disbanded and absorbed into the CIA. Brandt, knowing Hunley will try to capture Hunt, warns him to stay undercover. Cut off from the IMF, Hunt follows his only lead: the man in glasses, later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane. Six months later, Hunt, still a fugitive living in Paris (luring a CIA team to a decoy safe house in Havana), enlists former colleague Benji Dunn to attend an opera in Vienna, predicting that an assassination attempt will be made on the Austrian Chancellor at the performance, and that Lane will also be there. The two stop three snipers, including Faust, but the Chancellor is killed by a car bomb, and Lane is still not found. Faust drops hints of Lane's plan to Hunt before leaving. Dunn stays with Hunt instead of reporting back to the CIA, despite knowing his action amounts to treason. Hunt, blamed for the Chancellor's death, is pursued by the CIA's Special Activities Division. Brandt contacts Luther Stickell to find Hunt before the CIA does. Stickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to Casablanca, where they acquire a secret file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data, evading both Hunt and Syndicate members, although Hunt kills the pursuing agents. Dunn reveals he copied the data onto a second USB drive, as Stickell and Brandt catch up to them. Faust returns to London and attempts to use the file to quit her mission to infiltrate the Syndicate, but her MI6 handler, Atlee, compels her to continue, whilst discreetly wiping her drive. Meanwhile, Ethan learns that the data is an encrypted British government red box that requires the Prime Minister's biometrics to unlock it. Lane's men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to blackmail Hunt into decrypting the data and delivering it to them. Hunt agrees to the ultimatum, despite protests from Brandt. As part of Hunt's plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. At a London charity auction, Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee take the PM to a secure room to protect him from Hunt. Brandt has the PM confirm the existence of the Syndicate, a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, effectively making the PM ""judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability"", before Atlee reveals himself as Hunt in a mask. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission, and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6. With the PM's biometrics, Stickell discovers the file contains access to 2.4 billion British pounds in various bank accounts, which would allow the Syndicate to continue their operations unnoticed; Hunt promptly destroys the data. At the meeting, outside the Tower of London, he tells Lane he memorized the data, and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Ethan and Faust are chased through the streets of London by Lane's men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Ethan confronts Lane and lures him into a sealed, bulletproof glass cell where he is gassed unconscious and taken into custody. Hunley, having witnessed an IMF operation's success firsthand, returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and convinces them to restore the IMF by covering for Hunt and his team. After the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, an IMF Field Operations Director Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent undercover in the Syndicate Alec Baldwin as Alan Hunley, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Sean Harris as Solomon Lane, a former MI6 agent who went rogue and became the supreme leader of the Syndicate Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell, an IMF agent and computer specialist Simon McBurney as Atlee, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service Tom Hollander as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Zhang Jingchu as Lauren, a CIA analyst Jens Hultén as Janik Vinter, a former KGB operative and Lane's second-in-command Hermione Corfield as an IMF agent who doubles as a record-shop keeper in London Production[edit] Pre-production[edit] Paramount Pictures announced in August 2013 that Christopher McQuarrie would direct the fifth Mission: Impossible film, from a script by Drew Pearce, with Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. Tom Cruise Productions and Bad Robot would produce, and Skydance Productions, who served as co-financers and executive producers of the latest installment, will work closely with the team in the development and production process.""[5] On November 14, 2013, Paramount announced a release date of December 25, 2015.[6] The same month, Simon Pegg confirmed he would reprise his role as Benji.[7] In May 2014, Will Staples replaced Pearce as screenwriter.[8] Also that month, Jeremy Renner confirmed he was returning in the role of William Brandt,[9] and Cruise said the film would shoot in London,[10] with a later report saying it would first shoot in Vienna in August.[11] At some point, McQuarrie replaced Staples as screenwriter; the final credits list McQuarrie as screenwriter, with story by Pearce. In July 2014, Rebecca Ferguson was cast and Alec Baldwin was in talks for the film.[12][13] Baldwin was confirmed to have joined the cast in August 2014,[14] and Ving Rhames was confirmed to be reprising his role of Luther Stickell.[15] On September 5, it was announced that Sean Harris was in negotiations for the villain role.[16] On October 2, Simon McBurney joined the cast of the film.[17] On October 6, Chinese actress Zhang Jingchu joined the film's cast (she only appears for 30 seconds in the finished film).[18][19] On March 22, 2015, Paramount revealed the film's official title, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, along with a teaser poster and trailer.[20] Filming[edit] This particular Airbus A400M Atlas, registered F-WWMZ, was used to film the action scene at RAF Wittering Principal photography began in August 2014. On August 21, the production released its first photos from the set in Vienna, Austria.[14] In August actors Cruise and Pegg, along with director Christopher McQuarrie, were in Vienna, at the Metro[21] and on the roof-top of Vienna State Opera.[21][22][23] After finishing one and a half weeks of filming in Austria, on August 30, Cruise arrived in the Moroccan capital city of Rabat for filming more scenes.[24][25] Here the Marrakesh Highway was closed for 14 days (August 30–September 12). Other filming locations in Morocco include Agadir, Rabat[26] and.[27][28][29] On September 8 and 9, filming took place in The Marrakesh Stadium, which was closed both days for filming purposes,[30] and Kasbah of the Udayas, in Rabat.[31] After more than a month of shooting in Austria and Morocco, filming moved to London on September 28.[32] On October 10, Cruise and his stuntman Wade Eastwood were filming some scenes in Monaco.[33] Filming of an action scene featuring Ethan Hunt climbing and hanging on the outside of a flying Atlas C1 took place at RAF Wittering near Stamford. Tom Cruise performed the sequence, at times suspended on the aircraft over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in the air, without the use of a stunt double.[34] To pull off this particular stunt, the production team were given a limited period of only 48 hours. The plane took off and landed 8 times before they had the perfect shot.[35] On November 9, filming began on Southampton Water, and Fawley Power Station.[36] Tom Cruise trained under diving specialist Kirk Krack to be able to hold his breath for three minutes to perform an underwater sequence which was filmed in a single long take without any edits (though the scene in the movie was cut with several breaks, giving the impression for the scene having several takes).[37] However, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood claims that Cruise held his breath for just over six minutes.[35] On February 20, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter said filming was halted to give McQuarrie, Cruise, and an unknown third person time to rework the film's ending.[38] Filming ended on March 12, 2015.[39] Soundtrack[edit] The musical score for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was composed by Joe Kraemer, who previously collaborated with director McQuarrie on The Way of the Gun and Jack Reacher. Kraemer was announced as the composer for the film in September 2014.[40] The soundtrack was recorded with small orchestral sections at British Grove Studios and with full orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.[41][42] As well as incorporating Lalo Schifrin's thematic material from the television series throughout the score, three tracks (""Escape to Danger,"" ""A Matter of Going"", and ""Finale and Curtain Call"") interpolate Puccini's Nessun dorma aria.[42][43] The physical soundtrack became available from La-La Land Records on July 28, 2015, with the digital album released from Paramount Music on the same day.

On January 26, 2015, Paramount advanced the release date to July 31, 2015.[44] The main reason cited by The Hollywood Reporter was to avoid competition with two other 2015 films, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Spectre.[45] In the United States and Canada, it was released in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema, the first ever time for Paramount.[46] On February 13, 2015, Paramount and IMAX Corporation announced that they would digitally re-master the film into the IMAX format and release it in IMAX theaters worldwide on the scheduled date.[47] The film was completed at 2:00AM on July 18, 2015, less than two weeks before its release date. The film was officially released in North America on July 31, 2015. Lotte released the film in South Korea on July 30, 2015.[48] The film was released in China on September 8, 2015.[49] In August 2015, Fox Networks acquired the US cable broadcast rights, for broadcast after its theatrical release. The film will be available for FX Networks and its suite of networks: FX, FXX, FXM, and the video-on-demand platform FXNow.[50] Marketing[edit] A teaser trailer for the film was released on March 22, 2015.[51] The following day, a full-length trailer was released.[52] A second full-length trailer was released on June 3, 2015. Paramount Pictures spent $42 million on advertising for the film.[53] A comic book was released in conjunction with the film's DVD/Blu-ray release. It follows Hunt going rogue during the events of the film. The comic is written by the film's writer and director Christopher McQuarrie and illustrations by Lazarus artist Owen Freeman.[54] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation grossed $195 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $487.7 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $682.7 million.[3] Although Rogue Nation was projected to become the highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the biggest movie for Cruise,[55] it apparently fell short of eclipsing Ghost Protocol's final gross to become the second-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film and the second biggest film for Cruise.[56] It had a worldwide opening of $121 million and an IMAX worldwide opening total of $12.5 million (the third-biggest of July behind The Dark Knight Rises and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2).[57] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $108.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.[58] United States and Canada[edit] In the United States and Canada, according to pre-release tracking, the film was projected to earn around $40–50 million in its opening weekend, less than what the first three Mission: Impossible films earned in their initial weekend.[59][60][61] It made $4 million from its Thursday night showings which began at 8 p.m. from 2,764 theaters,[62][63] and $20.3 million on its opening day, which is the second-biggest opening day for Cruise (behind War of the Worlds) and the biggest in the Mission: Impossible franchise (breaking Mission: Impossible 2's record), with 16% of ticket sales from the film's 367 IMAX theaters.[59][64][65] In its opening weekend the film grossed $55.5 million exceeding expectations and is the second-highest opening in the franchise, behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($57.8 million) and the third-biggest for Cruise behind War of the Worlds ($64.8 million) and Mission: Impossible 2.[66][67] IMAX contributed $8.4 million of the total opening gross from 369 IMAX screens which is the third-best for a July opening after The Dark Knight Rises ($19 million) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 ($15.2 million). Premium large format grossed up $2.6 million, 13% of Friday's gross with Cinemark XD grossing close to $700,000 at 108 screens.[66] It remained at the top spot for the second weekend earning an estimated $28.5 million (down 48.7%) from 3,988 theaters (32+ theaters) buoyed by strong word of mouth, rapturous reviews and strong plays at IMAX theaters.[68] Revenues from IMAX also dropped steadily by 39% to $4.3 million in its second weekend.[69] It topped the North American box office for two consecutive weekends until surpassed by the music biographical drama Straight Outta Compton in its third weekend.[70][71][72] It ended its theatrical run on October 29, 2015, playing in theaters for a total of 91 days, or 13 weeks, earning a total of $195 million at the North American box office which is just 28.6% of its total worldwide gross.[3] It is the third-highest-grossing Mission: Impossible film behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($215 million) and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol ($209 million).[56] Other countries[edit] Elsewhere, the film opened in 40 overseas markets including 135 IMAX theaters on July 31, 2015 in big markets such the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia.[59] It grossed $64.5 million in its opening weekend and went No. 1 in 33 markets and IMAX contributed $4.1 million of its international opening.[57] Revenues from its second weekend increased by 0.5% to $65 million. It added 18 new markets including India, Japan, and Russia and opened at No. 1 in 17 of the 18 markets with the exception of Japan where it was behind Jurassic World.[73] Overall, it opened at No. 1 in 55 of the 63 territories it has been released in and had the biggest opening weekend ever for the franchise in 46 markets and Cruise's best opening in 40 markets.[57][73][74] It topped the box office outside of North America for three consecutive weekends before being overtaken by Paramount's own Terminator Genisys in its fourth weekend[74][75] and four in total.[76] It had the biggest opening for the franchise in the UK, Ireland and Malta ($8.3 million), France ($7 million), India ($6.5 million), Japan ($6.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($5.3 million), Mexico ($5 million), the Middle East ($4.7; including $2.5 million from UAE alone), Taiwan ($5.1 million), Australia ($3.8 million), Germany ($3.2 million) and Brazil ($3.1 million).[57][73][75][77] In South Korea, where the franchise has been a hit it opened to $16.95 million (49% above Ghost Protocol), which is the second-biggest opening ever for Paramount, behind Transformers: Dark of the Moon; Cruise's biggest-ever opening; the best for the Mission: Impossible franchise; and the second-biggest opening for a Western film of 2015.[57][78] It added $8.1 and $3.7 million in its second and third weekend for a total of $41.1 million making South Korea the film's second-highest market followed by Japan ($41.2 million), the United Kingdom ($32 million), France ($20.9 million), and Germany ($13 million).[79][80][81][82] In Japan, it faced competition with the continued run of Jurassic World.[83] In China, Rogue Nation emerged very successful and earned $18.5 million on its opening day of September 8 (including $1.4 million from midnight screenings), which is the country's biggest opening for a Hollywood 2D film, the second-biggest for any 2D film in China (only behind the $22.2 million debut of local 2D film Pancake Man), and the fifth-biggest opening for any film.[84][85] Despite opening on a Tuesday—during which most children are off to school—the film opened successfully and almost matched the opening figure of North America. Rob Cain of Forbes cited out possible reasons for the successful opening: the well-establishment of the franchise in China (its immediate predecessor Ghost Protocol earned $102.7 million), rapid expansion and growth of Chinese movie market, being the second Hollywood movie (after Terminator Genisys) to be released after the nearly 60-day blackout period in which non-Chinese movies were dabarred from going to general release in the country, and the successful awareness campaign and marketing efforts by the team including Tom Cruise visiting several Chinese cities.[85] It went on to earn an estimated $85.8 million through its opening weekend (Tuesday–Sunday) from 5,500 screens.[76] It is the highest-grossing 2D Hollywood film there with $136.8 million (breaking Interstellar's record).[81][82][86][87] Rogue Nation was projected to make roughly 70% of its worldwide gross abroad,[64] and indeed ended up making $487,287,762 or 71.4% of its entire worldwide gross overseas[3] which is the highest among the series.[56] Critical response[edit] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation has a rating of 93% based on 293 reviews and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation continues the franchise's thrilling resurgence—and proves that Tom Cruise remains an action star without equal.""[88] Metacritic gives the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[89] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of ""A–"" on an A+ to F scale.[90] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film ""preposterously enjoyable"" and said that it ""unfolds with fluid, twisty, old-school pleasure,"" highlighting the performances of Cruise, Pegg, Ferguson, and Baldwin and comparing the action scenes to those of the James Bond films as well as Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). He ultimately gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.[91] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Rogue Nation 3.5 out of 4 stars, highly praising the film's cast and stating that the film ""keeps topping itself"". However, he criticized the villain for not being too memorable or intimidating.[92] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that McQuarrie's direction allowed Rogue Nation to stand out among the other films in terms of action and its inclusion of female characters, singling out Ferguson's Ilsa as uniquely empowered and action-oriented, also praising her scenes with Cruise.[93] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic praised Cruise, saying ""You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer, unvarnished willpower, a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance"" and describing him as the driving force of the film and the franchise. He, too, praised Ferguson among the supporting cast for her role as an action heroine.[94] Joseph Wigler of MTV.com considered the movie as ""one of the most entertaining Ethan Hunt adventures"" which proves that ""the franchise still has plenty of fight left in it, with no signs of slowing down.""[95] He praised the performances of Cruise and Ferguson,[95] applauding the latter for playing ""the most fascinating character in the entire movie"" and ""one of the most complicated and alluring characters in the entire five film series.""[96] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated ""Sleek and bloated, specific and generic, 'Rogue Nation' is pretty much like most of the 'Impossible' movies in that it’s an immense machine that Mr. McQuarrie, after tinkering and oiling, has cranked up again and set humming with twists and turns, global trotting and gadgets, a crack supporting cast and a hard-working star.""[97] A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club remarked, ""Rather than go full auteur on his formulaic material, McQuarrie instead offers a kind of greatest-hits package: 'Rogue Nation' marries the shifting loyalties of Brian De Palma's original to the kinetic action beats of John Woo’s series nadir and the all-set-piece structure of Brad Bird's series zenith, adding an omnipotent villain not far removed from the one Philip Seymour Hoffman played in J.J. Abrams' entry. It’s the least visually or conceptually distinctive of the five movies, leaning on what's worked before rather than forging its own path.""[98] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, calling it ""breathlessly thrilling"" and giving high praise to its action sequences, saying "" all you can do is pick your jaw off your lap and grin at the breathtakingly bananas spectacle you've just witnessed.""[99] Meanwhile, David Edelstein of Vulture.com called Ferguson the ""best reason"" to see the film. However, he felt it did not surpass its predecessor and singled out several elements of some of the action sequences for criticism.[100] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal also praised Ferguson but felt that she and Cruise had ""zero chemistry"" onscreen. Nonetheless, he praised the film for working ""ingenious changes on old tropes"".[101] Daniel Krupa of IGN only gave the film a score of 7/10, praising the action sequences and the performances of the central cast but criticizing it for not adding enough to the series or expanding on the plot of Ghost Protocol.[102] Accolades[edit] By May 2015, Paramount was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Cruise, Abrams, Ellison, and Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development.[114] Christopher McQuarrie returned to write and direct the film, which began filming April 2017 for a July 2018 release.[115] References[edit] ^ a b c d e Grierson, Tim (July 23, 2015).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%E2%80%93_Fallout,"Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an upcoming American action spy film written, directed and produced by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the sixth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series and stars Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin, and Sean Harris who all reprise their roles from previous films. Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, Sian Brooke, and Angela Bassett will join the franchise. The film is scheduled to be released on July 27, 2018, and will be the first in the series to be released in RealD 3D and IMAX 3D. The film will also have a 2D IMAX release. McQuarrie is also the first director to direct two films in the franchise. Premise[edit] When an IMF mission ends badly, the world is faced with dire consequences. As Ethan Hunt takes it upon himself to fulfill his original briefing, the CIA begins to question his loyalty and his motives. Hunt finds himself in a race against time, hunted by assassins and former allies while trying to prevent a global catastrophe. Production[edit] On May 23, 2015, The Tracking Board reported that Paramount Pictures was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film with Tom Cruise, J. J. Abrams for Bad Robot, and David Ellison and Dana Goldberg returning to produce the film for Skydance, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm executive producing and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development.[13] On July 28, 2015, Cruise confirmed on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart that a sixth film was already being developed, and he told Jon Stewart that the shooting of the film would start in summer 2016.[14] Later on August 2, 2015, Paramount's executive Rob Moore told Variety that the sequel was already in works, stating that they were ""very happy to be developing this movie with Tom,"" and ""there has to be another movie.""[15] On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Paramount had hired again Christopher McQuarrie to write the film while it was possible that he would also direct the film, and the studio was moving fast with plans for shooting to start in August 2016.[16] On November 30, 2015, McQuarrie confirmed through his Twitter account that he would be back for directing duty as well, and would also produce the film along with Cruise.[17][18] On December 8, 2015, Showbiz411 confirmed that the fifth film's female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, would be returning for the sequel.[2] On August 19, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Paramount had halted pre-production on the film due to dispute over salary between Cruise and the studio, which Cruise wanted to get equal or more what he was being paid by Universal Studios for the film The Mummy.[19] On September 16, THR confirmed that Cruise's dispute over salary with the studio had been resolved and the production would now begin in Spring 2017.[1] In November, Jeremy Renner—who portrayed William Brandt in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation—stated that he was unsure if he would be part of the sixth film, due to scheduling conflicts with Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and its untitled sequel (2019).[20] His non-inclusion was confirmed in March 2017 at CinemaCon.[3] In February, McQuarrie revealed that the film would include more backstory to Hunt's personal life.[21] On June 13, 2017, Michelle Monaghan was announced to return as Ethan Hunt's wife Julia Meade.[4] Filming[edit] Filming was slated to start in Paris on April 10.[22] Other locations include Britain, India, New Zealand and Norway.[23][24] Filming officially began on April 8, 2017.[25] Some of the filming was also taking place in New Zealand in July 2017.[26] The municipality of Forsand in Norway allowed the closing of Preikestolen for a time in autumn for the film's shoot; only crew members and cast were allowed to approach the mountain for nine consecutive days. They also were allowed up to 50 helicopter landings per day.[27] In August 2017, Cruise injured his right leg on the London set during filming.[28][29] Following his accident, the studio halted the production for at least nine weeks which would be taken to heal Cruise's broken ankle and other injuries, and released a statement saying that they would be keeping the July 2018 release date for the film.[30] Filming resumed in early October 2017, with Tom Cruise spotted on set seven weeks after his initial injury, and two weeks earlier than initially planned.[31] Reshoots for Cavill's Justice League coincided with the schedule for Fallout, for which he had grown a moustache which he was contracted to keep while filming, so Justice League's VFX team was forced to use special effects to digitally remove it in post-production.[32] On January 25, 2018, the title was revealed to be Mission: Impossible – Fallout.[33] Filming concluded on March 25, 2018 in United Arab Emirates.[34] Release[edit] Mission: Impossible – Fallout is scheduled to be released on July 27, 2018, by Paramount Pictures in RealD 3D, IMAX and IMAX 3D.[35] The first trailer was released on February 4, 2018 during Super Bowl LII.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ a b Kit, Borys (September 16, 2016).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,"Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to ""learn"" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.[1] The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.[2] Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,[3] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,[5]:2 through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach,[6] optical character recognition (OCR),[7] learning to rank, and computer vision. Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,[8] where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning.[5]:vii[9] Machine learning can also be unsupervised[10] and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities[11] and then used to find meaningful anomalies. Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to ""produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results"" and uncover ""hidden insights"" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.[12] Effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver.[13][14] Overview[edit] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.""[15] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".[16] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed. Machine learning tasks[edit] Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether there is a learning ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to a learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback: Semi-supervised learning: the computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. Active learning: the computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling. Reinforcement learning: training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent.[5]:3 Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Machine learning applications[edit] Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:[5]:3 In classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are ""spam"" and ""not spam"". In regression, also a supervised problem, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. In clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task. Density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space. Dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics. Among other categories of machine learning problems, learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience. Developmental learning, elaborated for robot learning, generates its own sequences (also called curriculum) of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation. History and relationships to other fields[edit] Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term ""Machine Learning"" in 1959 while at IBM[17]. As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[19]:25 Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[20] It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the Internet. Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.[21] Relation to statistics[edit] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields. According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[22] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[22] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[23] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[24] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[25][26] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error. For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[27] In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches[edit] Decision tree learning[edit] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model, which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value. Association rule learning[edit] Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Artificial neural networks[edit] An artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called ""neural network"" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is vaguely inspired by biological neural networks. Computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables. Deep learning[edit] Falling hardware prices and the development of GPUs for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[28] Inductive logic programming[edit] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Support vector machines[edit] Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. Clustering[edit] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness (similarity between members of the same cluster) and separation between different clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data analysis. Bayesian networks[edit] A Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Reinforcement learning[edit] Reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of long-term reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected. Representation learning[edit] Several learning algorithms, mostly unsupervised learning algorithms, aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. Classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions, allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse (has many zeros). Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors.[29] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[30] Similarity and metric learning[edit] In this problem, the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects. It then needs to learn a similarity function (or a distance metric function) that can predict if new objects are similar. It is sometimes used in Recommendation systems. Sparse dictionary learning[edit] In this method, a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse. Let x be a d-dimensional datum, D be a d by n matrix, where each column of D represents a basis function. r is the coefficient to represent x using D. Mathematically, sparse dictionary learning means solving x  D r {\displaystyle x\approx Dr} where r is sparse. Generally speaking, n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation. Learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard and also difficult to solve approximately.[31] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is K-SVD. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to. Suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built. Then a new datum is associated with the class such that it's best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[32] Genetic algorithms[edit] A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, and uses methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms found some uses in the 1980s and 1990s.[33][34] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[35] Rule-based machine learning[edit] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply, knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[36] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Learning classifier systems[edit] Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component (e.g. typically a genetic algorithm) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning). They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[37] Applications[edit] Applications for machine learning include: In 2006, the online movie company Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[43] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[44] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of Machine Learning to predict the financial crisis. [45] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[46] In 2014, it has been reported that a machine learning algorithm has been applied in Art History to study fine art paintings, and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences between artists.[47] Model assessments[edit] Classification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the N-fold-cross-validation method randomly splits the data in k subsets where the k-1 instances of the data are used to train the model while the kth instance is used to test the predictive ability of the training model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[48] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the False Negative Rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated Area Under the Curve (AUC).[49] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[50] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[51][52] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning. Because language contains biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn bias.[53] Software[edit] Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following : Free and open-source software[edit] Proprietary software with free and open-source editions[edit] Proprietary software[edit] Journals[edit] Conferences[edit] See also[edit] References[edit] ^ Supposedly paraphrased from: Samuel, Arthur (1959).

The serious medical condition slowly started robbing him of his vision. However, it failed to deter his spirit, passion and ambition. Today, even though his condition may have rendered him 90 percent blind, Aman has successfully overcome the odds. An exemplary IAS officer from the 2013 batch of the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territories) cadre, he is known for finalising recruitment rules in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation that were pending for over 30 years. Source: Twitter/Aman Gupta Aman holds three top posts including director (personnel), additional director (education) and secretary to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) commissioner. He has also served as the deputy commissioner (west zone) and has served as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) for Chanakyapuri under the Delhi Government. It was due to his hard work and vision that hundreds of employees earned the promotion they deserved. He is dedicated to improving the ranking of South Delhi Municipal Corporation in Swachh Survekshan 2018. An IIM graduate with a Btech degree, Amit had attempted the UPSC Civil Services Examination in 2012, using audio books to prepare for the exam, but couldnât get through. However, he continued to work hard and secured the 57th All India rank in the general category in 2013. Though his vision may blur his capability to distinguish people by their features, his work doesn’t suffer. Amit uses a stand-mounted American video magnifier to work to read. And though the effort may be 200% more time consuming, he never piles work for the next day.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,"Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to ""learn"" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.[1] The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.[2] Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,[3] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,[5]:2 through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach,[6] optical character recognition (OCR),[7] learning to rank, and computer vision. Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,[8] where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning.[5]:vii[9] Machine learning can also be unsupervised[10] and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities[11] and then used to find meaningful anomalies. Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is a method used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics. These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to ""produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results"" and uncover ""hidden insights"" through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data.[12] Effective machine learning is difficult because finding patterns is hard and often not enough training data are available; as a result, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver.[13][14] Overview[edit] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.""[15] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".[16] In Turing's proposal the various characteristics that could be possessed by a thinking machine and the various implications in constructing one are exposed. Machine learning tasks[edit] Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether there is a learning ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to a learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. As special cases, the input signal can be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback: Semi-supervised learning: the computer is given only an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. Active learning: the computer can only obtain training labels for a limited set of instances (based on a budget), and also has to optimize its choice of objects to acquire labels for. When used interactively, these can be presented to the user for labeling. Reinforcement learning: training data (in form of rewards and punishments) is given only as feedback to the program's actions in a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent.[5]:3 Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Machine learning applications[edit] Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system:[5]:3 In classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are ""spam"" and ""not spam"". In regression, also a supervised problem, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete. In clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task. Density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space. Dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics. Among other categories of machine learning problems, learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience. Developmental learning, elaborated for robot learning, generates its own sequences (also called curriculum) of learning situations to cumulatively acquire repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation. History and relationships to other fields[edit] Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term ""Machine Learning"" in 1959 while at IBM[17]. As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[19]:708–710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[19]:25 Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[20] It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the Internet. Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.[21] Relation to statistics[edit] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields. According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[22] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[22] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[23] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[24] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[25][26] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error. For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[27] In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches[edit] Decision tree learning[edit] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model, which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item's target value. Association rule learning[edit] Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. Artificial neural networks[edit] An artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called ""neural network"" (NN), is a learning algorithm that is vaguely inspired by biological neural networks. Computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables. Deep learning[edit] Falling hardware prices and the development of GPUs for personal use in the last few years have contributed to the development of the concept of deep learning which consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[28] Inductive logic programming[edit] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Support vector machines[edit] Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. Clustering[edit] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness (similarity between members of the same cluster) and separation between different clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data analysis. Bayesian networks[edit] A Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Reinforcement learning[edit] Reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of long-term reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected. Representation learning[edit] Several learning algorithms, mostly unsupervised learning algorithms, aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. Classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions, allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution. Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse (has many zeros). Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors.[29] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[30] Similarity and metric learning[edit] In this problem, the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects. It then needs to learn a similarity function (or a distance metric function) that can predict if new objects are similar. It is sometimes used in Recommendation systems. Sparse dictionary learning[edit] In this method, a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse. Let x be a d-dimensional datum, D be a d by n matrix, where each column of D represents a basis function. r is the coefficient to represent x using D. Mathematically, sparse dictionary learning means solving x  D r {\displaystyle x\approx Dr} where r is sparse. Generally speaking, n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation. Learning a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard and also difficult to solve approximately.[31] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is K-SVD. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to. Suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built. Then a new datum is associated with the class such that it's best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[32] Genetic algorithms[edit] A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, and uses methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotype in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms found some uses in the 1980s and 1990s.[33][34] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[35] Rule-based machine learning[edit] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply, knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[36] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Learning classifier systems[edit] Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component (e.g. typically a genetic algorithm) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning). They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[37] Applications[edit] Applications for machine learning include: In 2006, the online movie company Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[43] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[44] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of Machine Learning to predict the financial crisis. [45] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[46] In 2014, it has been reported that a machine learning algorithm has been applied in Art History to study fine art paintings, and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences between artists.[47] Model assessments[edit] Classification machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the Holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the N-fold-cross-validation method randomly splits the data in k subsets where the k-1 instances of the data are used to train the model while the kth instance is used to test the predictive ability of the training model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[48] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the False Positive Rate (FPR) as well as the False Negative Rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated Area Under the Curve (AUC).[49] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[50] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[51][52] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning. Because language contains biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn bias.[53] Software[edit] Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following : Free and open-source software[edit] Proprietary software with free and open-source editions[edit] Proprietary software[edit] Journals[edit] Conferences[edit] See also[edit] References[edit] ^ Supposedly paraphrased from: Samuel, Arthur (1959).

The serious medical condition slowly started robbing him of his vision. However, it failed to deter his spirit, passion and ambition. Today, even though his condition may have rendered him 90 percent blind, Aman has successfully overcome the odds. An exemplary IAS officer from the 2013 batch of the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territories) cadre, he is known for finalising recruitment rules in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation that were pending for over 30 years. Source: Twitter/Aman Gupta Aman holds three top posts including director (personnel), additional director (education) and secretary to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) commissioner. He has also served as the deputy commissioner (west zone) and has served as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) for Chanakyapuri under the Delhi Government. It was due to his hard work and vision that hundreds of employees earned the promotion they deserved. He is dedicated to improving the ranking of South Delhi Municipal Corporation in Swachh Survekshan 2018. An IIM graduate with a Btech degree, Amit had attempted the UPSC Civil Services Examination in 2012, using audio books to prepare for the exam, but couldnât get through. However, he continued to work hard and secured the 57th All India rank in the general category in 2013. Though his vision may blur his capability to distinguish people by their features, his work doesn’t suffer. Amit uses a stand-mounted American video magnifier to work to read. And though the effort may be 200% more time consuming, he never piles work for the next day.

When notified about the happenings, he issued show cause notices to the accused officials. Often spotted deeply concentrating in his video magnifier, he is lauded as one of the top officials in SDMC’s education department. Speaking to TOI, SDMC commissioner Puneet Kumar Goel said IAS Amit Gupta was very meticulous. He successfully shoulders the responsibility of over 600 schools with 2.5 lakh students, reports the Times of India. Like this story? Or have something to share?
